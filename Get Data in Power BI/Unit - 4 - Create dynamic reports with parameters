Dynamic reports are reports in which the data can be changed by a developer according to user specifications. Dynamic reports are valuable because a single report can be used for multiple purposes. If you use dynamic reports, you'll have fewer individual reports to create, which will save organizational time and resources.
You can use parameters by determining the values that you want to see data for in the report, and the report updates accordingly by filtering the data for you.
Creating dynamic reports allows you to give users more power over the data that is displayed in your reports; they can change the data source and filter the data by themselves.
In the following example, you've created a report for the Sales team at Tailwind Traders that displays the sales data in the SQL Server database. The report gives a holistic view of how the Sales team is performing. While the report is useful, the Sales team members want to be able to filter the report so that they can view their own data only and track their performance against their sales targets.
