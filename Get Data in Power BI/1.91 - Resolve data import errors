While importing data into Power BI, you may encounter errors resulting from factors such as:
Power BI imports from numerous data sources.
Each data source might have dozens (and sometimes hundreds) of different error messages.
Other components can cause errors, such as hard drives, networks, software services, and operating systems.
Data often can't comply with any specific schema.
The following sections cover some of the more common error messages that you might encounter in Power BI.

Query timeout expired
Relational source systems often have many people who are concurrently using the same data in the same database. Some relational systems and their administrators seek to limit a user from monopolizing all hardware resources by setting a query timeout. These timeouts can be configured for any timespan, from as little as five seconds to as much as 30 minutes or more.

Power BI Query Error: Timeout expired
This error indicates that you’ve pulled too much data according to your organization’s policies. Administrators incorporate this policy to avoid slowing down a different application or suite of applications that might also be using that database.
You can resolve this error by pulling fewer columns or rows from a single table. While you're writing SQL statements, it might be a common practice to include groupings and aggregations. You can also join multiple tables in a single SQL statement. Additionally, you can perform complicated subqueries and nested queries in a single statement. These complexities add to the query processing requirements of the relational system and can greatly elongate the time of implementation.
If you need the rows, columns, and complexity, consider taking small chunks of data and then bringing them back together by using Power Query. For instance, you can combine half the columns in one query and the other half in a different query. Power Query can merge those two queries back together after you're finished.
