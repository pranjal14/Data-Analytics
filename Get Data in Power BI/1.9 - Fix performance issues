Occasionally, organizations will need to address performance issues when running reports. Power BI provides the Performance Analyzer tool to help fix problems and streamline the process.
Consider the scenario where you're building reports for the Sales team in your organization. You’ve imported your data, which is in several tables within the Sales team’s SQL database, by creating a data connection to the database through DirectQuery. When you create preliminary visuals and filters, you notice that some tables are queried faster than others, and some filters are taking longer to process compared to others.

Optimize performance in Power Query
The performance in Power Query depends on the performance at the data source level. The variety of data sources that Power Query offers is wide, and the performance tuning techniques for each source are equally wide. For instance, if you extract data from a Microsoft SQL Server, you should follow the performance tuning guidelines for the product. Good SQL Server performance tuning techniques include index creation, hardware upgrades, execution plan tuning, and data compression. These topics are beyond the scope here, and are covered only as an example to build familiarity with your data source and reap the benefits when using Power BI and Power Query.
Power Query takes advantage of good performance at the data source through a technique called Query Folding.
