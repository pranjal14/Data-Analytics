The most popular way to use data in Power BI is to import it into a Power BI semantic model. Importing the data means that the data is stored in the Power BI file and gets published along with the Power BI reports. This process helps make it easier for you to interact directly with your data. However, this approach might not work for all organizations.
To continue with the scenario, you're building Power BI reports for the Sales department at Tailwind Traders, where importing the data isn't an ideal method. The first task you need to accomplish is to create your semantic models in Power BI so you can build visuals and other report elements. The Sales department has many different semantic models of varying sizes. For security reasons, you aren't allowed to import local copies of the data into your reports, so directly importing data is no longer an option. Therefore, you need to create a direct connection to the Sales departmentâ€™s data source. The following section describes how you can ensure that these business requirements are satisfied when you're importing data into Power BI.
However, sometimes there may be security requirements around your data that make it impossible to directly import a copy. Or your semantic models may simply be too large and would take too long to load into Power BI, and you want to avoid creating a performance bottleneck. Power BI solves these problems by using the DirectQuery storage mode, which allows you to query the data in the data source directly and not import a copy into Power BI. DirectQuery is useful because it ensures you're always viewing the most recent version of the data.

The three different types of storage modes you can choose from:
Import
DirectQuery
Dual (Composite)
You can access storage modes by switching to the Model view, selecting a data table, and in the resulting Properties pane, selecting which mode that you want to use from the Storage mode drop-down list, as shown in the following visual.
