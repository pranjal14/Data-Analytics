Some organizations don't use a relational database but instead use a NoSQL database. A NoSQL database (also referred to as non-SQL, not only SQL or non-relational) is a flexible type of database that doesn't use tables to store data.
Scenario
Software developers at Tailwind Traders created an application to manage shipping and tracking products from their warehouses. The application uses Cosmos DB, a NoSQL database, as the data repository. Data is stored as JSON documents, which are open standard file formats that are primarily used to transmit data between a server and web application. You need to import this data into a Power BI semantic model for reporting.
