Azure Analysis Services is a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) that provides enterprise-grade semantic models in the cloud. You can use advanced mashup and modeling features to combine data from multiple data sources, define metrics, and secure your data in a single, trusted tabular semantic model. The semantic model provides an easier and faster way for users to perform ad hoc data analysis using tools like Power BI.
To resume the scenario, Tailwind Traders uses Azure Analysis Services to store financial projection data. You’ve been asked to compare this data with actual sales data in a different database. Getting data from Azure Analysis Services server is similar to getting data from SQL Server, in that you can:
Authenticate to the server.
Pick the model you want to use.
Select which tables you need.
Notable differences between Azure Analysis Services and SQL Server are:
Analysis Services models have calculations already created.
If you don’t need an entire table, you can query the data directly. Instead of using Transact-SQL (T-SQL) to query the data, like you would in SQL Server, you can use multidimensional expressions (MDX) or data analysis expressions (DAX).
