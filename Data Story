Data Flow Process

Objective: Establish a solid foundation for data collection, analysis, and insights.

Step 1: Setting up Environment for Effective Tracking
1. Define Tracking Objectives
- Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) : 
- Determine business goals and outcomes
- Align tracking objectives with organizational strategy

2. Choose Analytical Tools
- Google Analytics (GA4) for web and mobile tracking
- Google Tag Manager (GTM) for tag management
- BigQuery for data warehousing and analysis
- AWS (optional) for additional data storage and processing

3. Set up Data Collection
- Install GA tracking code on website/mobile app
- Configure GTM tags for event tracking
- Enable data sharing between GA and BigQuery
- Set up data pipelines for AWS (if using)

4. Configure Data Environments
- Create separate environments for development, staging, and production
- Set up data access controls and permissions
- Ensure data compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)

5. Document Implementation
- Create implementation guide and documentation
- Share knowledge with team members and stakeholders
- Review and update documentation regularly

Step - 2 : Data Enablement

Data Layer Implementation: 
Data layer is a temporary store of data that is used to collect information needed to capture and send web analytics events to Google Analytics.
When a relevant web user interaction occurs (e.g. page load, card click, modal view, etc), the corresponding information for that event needs to be pushed to the data layer.
There’s a logic within the GTM that listens to pushes to the data layer and uses the information collected to send web analytics events to Google Analytics.
In technical terms, the data layer is a global JavaScript array of objects. When a user interaction occurs, the website/web application needs to push an “event” object to the array that includes appropriate data properties for that event.
