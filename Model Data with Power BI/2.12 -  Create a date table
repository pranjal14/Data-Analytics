During report creation in Power BI, a common business requirement is to make calculations based on date and time. Organizations want to know how their business is doing over months, quarters, fiscal years, and so on. For this reason, it is crucial that these time-oriented values are formatted correctly. Power BI auto detects for date columns and tables; however, situations can occur where you will need to take extra steps to get the dates in the format that your organization requires.
For example, suppose that you are developing reports for the Sales team at your organization. The database contains tables for sales, orders, products, and more. You notice that many of these tables, including Sales and Orders, contain their own date columns, as shown by the ShipDate and OrderDate columns in the Sales and Orders tables. You are tasked with developing a table of the total sales and orders by year and month. How can you build a visual with multiple tables, each referencing their own date columns?
To solve this problem, you can create a common date table that can be used by multiple tables. The following section explains how you can accomplish this task in Power BI.

Create a common date table
Ways that you can build a common date table are:
Source data
DAX
Power Query

Source data
Occasionally, source databases and data warehouses already have their own date tables. If the administrator who designed the database did a thorough job, these tables can be used to perform the following tasks:
Identify company holiday
Separate calendar and fiscal year
Identify weekends versus weekdays
Source data tables are mature and ready for immediate use. If you have a table as such, bring it into your semantic model and don't use any other methods that are outlined in this section. We recommend that you use a source date table because it is likely shared with other tools that you might be using in addition to Power BI.
If you do not have a source data table, you can use other ways to build a common date table.
