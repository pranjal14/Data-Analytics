When a measure references one or more measures, it's known as a compound measure.
For this example, you will modify the Profit measure by using the following measure definition. Format the measure with two decimal places.

DAX
Profit =
[Revenue] - [Cost]

Next, add the Profit measure to the matrix visual.
Now that your model provides a way to summarize profit, you can delete the Profit Amount calculated column.
By removing this calculated column, you've optimized the semantic model. Removing this columns results in a decreased semantic model size and shorter data refresh times. The Profit Amount calculated column wasn't required because the Profit measure can directly produce the required result.
