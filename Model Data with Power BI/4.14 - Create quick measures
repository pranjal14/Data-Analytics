Microsoft Power BI Desktop includes a feature named Quick Measures. This feature helps you to quickly perform common, powerful calculations by generating the DAX expression for you.
Many categories of calculations and ways to modify each calculation are available to fit your needs. Moreover, you are able to see the DAX that's generated by the quick measure and use it to jumpstart or expand your DAX knowledge.
In this next example, you'll create another compound measure to calculate profit margin. However, this time, you'll create it as a quick measure.
In the Fields pane, select the Sales table. On the Table tools contextual ribbon, from inside the Calculations group, select Quick measure.
