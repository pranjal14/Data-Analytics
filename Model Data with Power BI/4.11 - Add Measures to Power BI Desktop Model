Measures in Microsoft Power BI models are either implicit or explicit. Implicit measures are automatic behaviors that allow visuals to summarize model column data. Explicit measures, also known simply as measures, are calculations that you can add to your model. This module focuses on how you can use implicit measures.

In the Fields pane, a column that's shown with the sigma symbol ( âˆ‘ ) indicates two facts:
It's a numeric column.
It will summarize column values when it is used in a visual (when added to a field well that supports summarization).
In the following image, notice that the Sales table includes only fields that can be summarized, including the Profit Amount calculated column.

As a data modeler, you can control if and how the column summarizes by setting the Summarization property to Don't summarize or to a specific aggregation function. When you set the Summarization property to Don't summarize, the sigma symbol will no longer show next to the column in the Fields pane.
To observe how report authors can use implicit measures, you can first download and open the Adventure Works DW 2020 M04.pbix file.
In the report, from the Sales table, add the Sales Amount field to the matrix visual that groups fiscal year and month on its rows.

To determine how the column is summarized, in the visual fields pane, for the Sales Amount field, select the arrow and then review the context menu options.
Notice that the Sum aggregation function has a check mark next to it. This check mark indicates that the column is summarized by summing column values together. It's also possible to change the aggregation function by selecting any of the other options like average, minimum, and so on.
Next, add the Unit Price field to the matrix visual.
The default summarization is now set to Average (the modeler knows that it's inappropriate to sum unit price values together because they're rates, which are non-additive).
Implicit measures allow the report author to start with a default summarization technique and lets them modify it to suit their visual requirements.

Numeric columns support the greatest range of aggregation functions:
Sum
Average
Minimum
Maximum
Count (Distinct)
Count
Standard deviation
Variance
Median

Summarize non-numeric columns
Non-numeric columns can be summarized. However, the sigma symbol does not show next to non-numeric columns in the Fields pane because they don't summarize by default.
Text columns allow the following aggregations:
First (alphabetically)
Last (alphabetically)
Count (Distinct)
Count
Date columns allow the following aggregations:
Earliest
Latest
Count (Distinct)
Count
Boolean columns allow the following aggregations:
Count (Distinct)
Count

Benefits of implicit measures
Several benefits are associated with implicit measures. Implicit measures are simple concepts to learn and use, and they provide flexibility in the way that report authors visualize model data. Additionally, they mean less work for you as a data modeler because you don't have to create explicit calculations.
