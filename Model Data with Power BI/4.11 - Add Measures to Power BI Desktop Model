Measures in Microsoft Power BI models are either implicit or explicit. Implicit measures are automatic behaviors that allow visuals to summarize model column data. Explicit measures, also known simply as measures, are calculations that you can add to your model. This module focuses on how you can use implicit measures.

In the Fields pane, a column that's shown with the sigma symbol ( âˆ‘ ) indicates two facts:
It's a numeric column.
It will summarize column values when it is used in a visual (when added to a field well that supports summarization).
In the following image, notice that the Sales table includes only fields that can be summarized, including the Profit Amount calculated column.

As a data modeler, you can control if and how the column summarizes by setting the Summarization property to Don't summarize or to a specific aggregation function. When you set the Summarization property to Don't summarize, the sigma symbol will no longer show next to the column in the Fields pane.
To observe how report authors can use implicit measures, you can first download and open the Adventure Works DW 2020 M04.pbix file.
In the report, from the Sales table, add the Sales Amount field to the matrix visual that groups fiscal year and month on its rows.
