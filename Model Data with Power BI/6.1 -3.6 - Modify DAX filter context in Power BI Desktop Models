Introduction
Filter context describes the filters that are applied during the evaluation of a measure or measure expression. Filters can be applied directly to columns, like a filter on the Fiscal Year column in the date table for the value FY2020. Additionally, filters can be applied indirectly, which happens when model relationships propagate filters to other tables. For example, the Sales table receives a filter through its relationship with the Date table, filtering the Sales table rows to those with an OrderDateKey column value in FY2020.
