You can write a DAX formula to add a measure to any table in your model. A measure formula must return a scalar or single value.
Note- In tabular modeling, no such concept as a calculated measure exists. The word calculated is used to describe calculated tables and calculated columns. It distinguishes them from tables and columns that originate from Power Query, which doesn't have the concept of an explicit measure.
Measures don't store values in the model. Instead, they're used at query time to return summarizations of model data. Additionally, measures can't reference a table or column directly; they must pass the table or column into a function to produce a summarization.
A simple measure is one that aggregates the values of a single column; it does what implicit measures do automatically.
In the next example, you will add a measure to the Sales table. In the Fields pane, select the Sales table. To create a measure, in the Table Tools contextual ribbon, from inside the Calculations group, select New measure.
