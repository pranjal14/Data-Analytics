You can write a DAX formula to add a measure to any table in your model. A measure formula must return a scalar or single value.
Note- In tabular modeling, no such concept as a calculated measure exists. The word calculated is used to describe calculated tables and calculated columns. It distinguishes them from tables and columns that originate from Power Query, which doesn't have the concept of an explicit measure.
Measures don't store values in the model. Instead, they're used at query time to return summarizations of model data. Additionally, measures can't reference a table or column directly; they must pass the table or column into a function to produce a summarization.
A simple measure is one that aggregates the values of a single column; it does what implicit measures do automatically.
In the next example, you will add a measure to the Sales table. In the Fields pane, select the Sales table. To create a measure, in the Table Tools contextual ribbon, from inside the Calculations group, select New measure.

In the formula bar, enter the following measure definition and then press Enter.

Revenue = SUM(Sales[Sales Amount])

The measure definition adds the Revenue measure to the Sales table. It uses the SUM DAX function to sum the values of the Sales Amount column.
On the Measure tools contextual ribbon, inside the Formatting group, set the decimal places to 2.
Now, add the Revenue measure to the matrix visual. Notice that it produces the same result as the Sales Amount implicit measure.
In the matrix visual, remove Sales Amount and Sum of Unit Price.
Next, you will create more measures. Create the Cost measure by using the following measure definition, and then set the format with two decimal places.
