You can use variables in your DAX formulas to help you write less complex and more efficient calculations. Variables are underused by developers who are starting out in Power BI Desktop, but they are effective and you should use them by default when you are creating measures.
Some expressions involve the use of many nested functions and the reuse of expression logic. These expressions take a longer time to process and are difficult to read and, therefore, troubleshoot. If you use variables, you can save query processing time. This change is a step in the right direction toward optimizing the performance of a semantic model.
