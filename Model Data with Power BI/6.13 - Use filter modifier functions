When using the CALCULATE function, you can pass in filter modification functions, which allow you to accomplish more than adding filters alone.
Remove filters
Use the REMOVEFILTERS DAX function as a CALCULATE filter expression to remove filters from filter context. It can remove filters from one or more columns or from all columns of a single table.

Note
The REMOVEFILTERS function is relatively new. In previous versions of DAX, you removed filters by using the ALL DAX function or variants including the ALLEXCEPT and the ALLNOBLANKROW DAX functions. These functions behave as both filter modifiers and as functions that return table objects of distinct values. These functions are mentioned now because you're likely to find documentation and formula examples that remove filters by using them.
