You can use the CALCULATE DAX function to modify filter context in your formulas. The syntax for the CALCULATE function is as follows:

DAX
CALCULATE(<expression>, [[<filter1>], <filter2>]â€¦)

The function requires passing in an expression that returns a scalar value and as many filters as you need. The expression can be a measure (which is a named expression) or any expression that can be evaluated in filter context.
Filters can be Boolean expressions or table expressions. It's also possible to pass in filter modification functions that provide additional control when you're modifying filter context.
When you have multiple filters, they're evaluated by using the AND logical operator, which means that all conditions must be TRUE at the same time.

Note
The CALCULATETABLE DAX function performs exactly the same functionality as the CALCULATE function, except that it modifies the filter context that's applied to an expression that returns a table object. In this module, the explanations and examples use the CALCULATE function, but keep in mind that these scenarios could also apply to the CALCULATETABLE function.

Apply Boolean expression filters
A Boolean expression filter is an expression that evaluates to TRUE or FALSE. Boolean filters must abide by the following rules:
They can reference only a single column.
They cannot reference measures.
They cannot use functions that scan or return a table that includes aggregation functions like SUM.
In this example, you will create a measure. First, download and open the Adventure Works DW 2020 M06.pbix file. Then add the following measure to the Sales table that filters the Revenue measure by using a Boolean expression filter for red products.

DAX
Revenue Red = CALCULATE([Revenue], 'Product'[Color] = "Red")

Add the Revenue Red measure to the table visual that is found on Page 1 of the report.
In this next example, the following measure filters the Revenue measure by multiple colors. Notice the use of the IN operator followed by a list of color values.

DAX
Revenue Red or Blue = CALCULATE([Revenue], 'Product'[Color] IN {"Red", "Blue"})
The following measure filters the Revenue measure by expensive products. Expensive products are those with a list price greater than USD 1000.
