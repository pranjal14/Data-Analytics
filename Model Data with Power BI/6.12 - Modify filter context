You can use the CALCULATE DAX function to modify filter context in your formulas. The syntax for the CALCULATE function is as follows:

DAX
CALCULATE(<expression>, [[<filter1>], <filter2>]â€¦)

The function requires passing in an expression that returns a scalar value and as many filters as you need. The expression can be a measure (which is a named expression) or any expression that can be evaluated in filter context.
Filters can be Boolean expressions or table expressions. It's also possible to pass in filter modification functions that provide additional control when you're modifying filter context.
When you have multiple filters, they're evaluated by using the AND logical operator, which means that all conditions must be TRUE at the same time.

Note
The CALCULATETABLE DAX function performs exactly the same functionality as the CALCULATE function, except that it modifies the filter context that's applied to an expression that returns a table object. In this module, the explanations and examples use the CALCULATE function, but keep in mind that these scenarios could also apply to the CALCULATETABLE function.
