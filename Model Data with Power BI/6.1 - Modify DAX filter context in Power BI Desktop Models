Introduction
Filter context describes the filters that are applied during the evaluation of a measure or measure expression. Filters can be applied directly to columns, like a filter on the Fiscal Year column in the date table for the value FY2020. Additionally, filters can be applied indirectly, which happens when model relationships propagate filters to other tables. For example, the Sales table receives a filter through its relationship with the Date table, filtering the Sales table rows to those with an OrderDateKey column value in FY2020.

At report design time, filters are applied in the Filters pane or to report visuals. The slicer visual is an example of a visual whose only purpose is to filter the report page (and other pages when it's configured as a synced slicer). Report visuals, which perform grouping, also apply filters. They're implied filters; the difference is that the filter result is visible in the visual. For example, a stacked column chart visual can filter by fiscal year FY2020, group by month, and summarize sales amount. The fiscal year filter isn't visible in the visual result, yet the grouping, which results in a column for each month, behaves as a filter.
