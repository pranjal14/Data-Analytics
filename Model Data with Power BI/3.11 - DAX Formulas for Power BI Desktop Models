In this module, you'll learn how to write DAX formulas to create calculated tables, calculated columns, and measures, which are different types of model calculations. Additionally, you'll learn how to write and format DAX formulas, which consist of expressions that use functions, operators, references to model objects, constants, and variables.

Introduction
By using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), you can add three types of calculations to your semantic model:
Calculated tables
Calculated columns
Measures
Calculated tables
You can write a DAX formula to add a calculated table to your model. The formula can duplicate or transform existing model data, or create a series of data, to produce a new table. Calculated table data is always imported into your model, so it increases the model storage size and can prolong data refresh time.
Note:A calculated table can't connect to external data; you need to use Power Query to accomplish that task.
Calculated tables can be useful in various scenarios:
Date tables
Role-playing dimensions
What-if analysis

Date tables
Date tables are required to apply special time filters known as time intelligence. DAX time intelligence functions only work correctly when a date table is set up. When your source data doesn't include a date table, you can create one as calculated tables by using the CALENDAR or CALENDARAUTO DAX functions.

Role-playing dimensions
When two model tables have multiple relationships, it could be because your model has a role-playing dimension. For example, if you have a table named Sales that includes two date columns, OrderDateKey and ShipDateKey, both columns are related to the Date column in the Date table. In this case, the Date table is described as a role-playing dimension because it could play the role of order date or ship date.
Microsoft Power BI models only allow one active relationship between tables, which in the model diagram is indicated as a solid line. The active relationship is used by default to propagate filters, which in this case would be from the Date table to the OrderDateKey column in the Sales table. Any remaining relationships between the two tables are inactive. In a model diagram, the relationships are represented as dashed lines. Inactive relationships are only used when they're expressly requested in a calculated formula by using the USERELATIONSHIP DAX function.
Perhaps a better model design could have two date tables, each with an active relationship to the Sales table. Thus, report users can filter by order date or ship date, or both at the same time. A calculated table can duplicate the Date table data to create the Ship Date table.

What-if analysis
Power BI Desktop supports a feature called What-if parameters. When you create a what-if parameter, a calculated table is automatically added to your model.
What-if parameters allow report users to select or filter by values that are stored in the calculated table. Measure formulas can use selected value(s) in a meaningful way. For example, a what-if parameter could allow the report user to select a hypothetical currency exchange rate, and a measure could divide revenue values (in a local currency) by the selected rate.
Notably, what-if calculated tables aren't related to other model tables because they're not used to propagate filters. For this reason, they're sometimes called disconnected tables.

Calculated columns
You can write a DAX formula to add a calculated column to any table in your model. The formula is evaluated for each table row and it returns a single value. When added to an Import storage mode table, the formula is evaluated when the semantic model is refreshed, and it increases the storage size of your model. When added to a DirectQuery storage mode table, the formula is evaluated by the underlying source database when the table is queried.
In the Fields pane, calculated columns are enhanced with a special icon. The following example shows a single calculated column in the Customer table called Age.
