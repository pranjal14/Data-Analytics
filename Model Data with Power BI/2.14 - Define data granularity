Data granularity is the detail that is represented within your data, meaning that the more granularity your data has, the greater the level of detail within your data.
Data granularity is an important topic for all data analysts, regardless of the Power BI tools that you're using. Defining the correct data granularity can have a big impact on the performance and usability of your Power BI reports and visuals.
