Data granularity is the detail that is represented within your data, meaning that the more granularity your data has, the greater the level of detail within your data.
Data granularity is an important topic for all data analysts, regardless of the Power BI tools that you're using. Defining the correct data granularity can have a big impact on the performance and usability of your Power BI reports and visuals.

Data granularity defined
Consider a scenario where your company manages 1,000 refrigerated semi-trucks. Every few minutes, each truck uses a Microsoft Azure IoT application to record its current temperature. This temperature is important to your organization because, if the refrigeration were to malfunction, it could spoil the entire load, costing thousands of dollars. With so many trucks and so many sensors, extensive data is generated every day. Your report users don't want to sift through numerous records to find the ones that they are particularly interested in.
How can you change the granularity of the data to make the semantic model more usable?
In this scenario, you might want to import the data by using a daily average for each truck. That approach would reduce the records in the database to one record for each truck for each day. If you decide that the approach was acceptable enough for tracking costs and errors, then you could use that data granularity. Alternatively, you could select the last recorded temperature, or you could only import records that are above or below a normal range of temperatures. Any of these methods will reduce the total records that you import, while still bringing in data that is comprehensive and valuable.
For different scenarios, you could settle on data granularity that is defined weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Generally, the fewer the records that you are working with, the faster your reports and visuals will function. This approach translates to a faster refresh rate for the entire semantic model, which might mean that you can refresh more frequently.
However, that approach has a drawback. If your users want to drill into every single transaction, summarizing the granularity will prevent them from doing that, which can have a negative impact on the user experience. It is important to negotiate the level of data granularity with report users so they understand the implications of these choices.
