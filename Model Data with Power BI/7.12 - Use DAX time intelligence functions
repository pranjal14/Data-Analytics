DAX includes several time intelligence functions to simplify the task of modifying date filter context. You could write many of these intelligence formulas by using a CALCULATE function that modifies date filters, but that would create more work.
Note
Many DAX time intelligence functions are concerned with standard date periods, specifically years, quarters, and months. If you have irregular time periods (for example, financial months that begin mid-way through the calendar month), or you need to work with weeks or time periods (hours, minutes, and so on), the DAX time intelligence functions won't be helpful. Instead, you'll need to use the CALCULATE function and pass in hand-crafted date or time filters.

Date table requirement
To work with time intelligence DAX functions, you need to meet the prerequisite model requirement of having at least one date table in your model. A date table is a table that meets the following requirements:
It must have a column of data type Date (or date/time), known as the date column.
The date column must contain unique values.
The date column must not contain BLANKs.
The date column must not have any missing dates.
The date column must span full years. A year isn't necessarily a calendar year (January-December).
The date table must be indicated as a date table.

Summarizations over time
One group of DAX time intelligence functions is concerned with summarizations over time:
DATESYTD - Returns a single-column table that contains dates for the year-to-date (YTD) in the current filter context. This group also includes the DATESMTD and DATESQTD DAX functions for month-to-date (MTD) and quarter-to-date (QTD). You can pass these functions as filters into the CALCULATE DAX function.
TOTALYTD - Evaluates an expression for YTD in the current filter context. The equivalent QTD and MTD DAX functions of TOTALQTD and TOTALMTD are also included.
DATESBETWEEN - Returns a table that contains a column of dates that begins with a given start date and continues until a given end date.
DATESINPERIOD - Returns a table that contains a column of dates that begins with a given start date and continues for the specified number of intervals.

Note
While the TOTALYTD function is simple to use, you are limited to passing in one filter expression. If you need to apply multiple filter expressions, use the CALCULATE function and then pass the DATESYTD function in as one of the filter expressions.

In the following example, you will create your first time intelligence calculation that will use the TOTALYTD function. The syntax is as follows:
TOTALYTD(<expression>, <dates>, [, <filter>][, <year_end_date>])
The function requires an expression and, as is common to all time intelligence functions, a reference to the date column of a marked date table. Optionally, a single filter expression or the year-end date can be passed in (required only when the year doesn't finish on December 31).

Download and open the Adventure Works DW 2020 M07.pbix file. Then, add the following measure definition to the Sales table that calculates YTD revenue. Format the measure as currency with two decimal places.
Revenue YTD =
TOTALYTD([Revenue], 'Date'[Date], "6-30")
The year-end date value of "6-30" represents June 30.
On Page 1 of the report, add the Revenue YTD measure to the matrix visual. Notice that it produces a summarization of the revenue amounts from the beginning of the year through to the filtered month.

Comparisons over time
Another group of DAX time intelligence functions is concerned with shifting time periods:
DATEADD - Returns a table that contains a column of dates, shifted either forward or backward in time by the specified number of intervals from the dates in the current filter context.
PARALLELPERIOD - Returns a table that contains a column of dates that represents a period that is parallel to the dates in the specified dates column, in the current filter context, with the dates shifted a number of intervals either forward in time or back in time.
SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR - Returns a table that contains a column of dates that are shifted one year back in time from the dates in the specified dates column, in the current filter context.
Many helper DAX functions for navigating backward or forward for specific time periods, all of which returns a table of dates. These helper functions include NEXTDAY, NEXTMONTH, NEXTQUARTER, NEXTYEAR, and PREVIOUSDAY, PREVIOUSMONTH, PREVIOUSQUARTER, and PREVIOUSYEAR.

Now, you will add a measure to the Sales table that calculates revenue for the prior year by using the SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR function. Format the measure as currency with two decimal places.
Revenue PY =
VAR RevenuePriorYear = CALCULATE([Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))
RETURN
    RevenuePriorYear

Add the Revenue PY measure to the matrix visual. Notice that it produces results that are similar to the previous year's revenue amounts.
