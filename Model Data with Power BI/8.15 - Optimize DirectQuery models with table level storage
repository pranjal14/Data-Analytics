DirectQuery is one way to get data into Power BI Desktop. The DirectQuery method involves connecting directly to data in its source repository from within Power BI Desktop. It is an alternative to importing data into Power BI Desktop.
When you use the DirectQuery method, the overall user experience depends heavily on the performance of the underlying data source. Slow query response times will lead to a negative user experience and, in the worst-case scenarios, queries might time out. Also, the number of users who are opening the reports at any one time will impact the load that is placed on the data source. For example, if your report has 20 visuals in it and 10 people are using the report, 200 queries or more will exist on the data source because each visual will issue one or more queries.
Unfortunately, the performance of your Power BI model will not only be impacted by the performance of the underlying data source, but also by other uncontrollable factors, such as:
Network latency; faster networks return data quicker.
The performance of the data source's server and how many other workloads are on that server. For example, consider the implications of a server refresh taking place while hundreds of people are using the same server for different reasons.
Therefore, using DirectQuery poses a risk to the quality of your model's performance. To optimize performance in this situation, you need to have control over, or access to, the source database.
