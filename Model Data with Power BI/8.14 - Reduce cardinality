Cardinality is a term that is used to describe the uniqueness of the values in a column. Cardinality is also used in the context of the relationships between two tables, where it describes the direction of the relationship.
Identify cardinality levels in columns
Previously, when you used Power Query Editor to analyze the metadata, the Column distribution option on the View tab displayed statistics on how many distinct and unique items were in each column in the data.

Distinct values count - The total number of different values found in a given column.
Unique values count - The total number of values that only appear once in a given column.
A column that has a lot of repeated values in its range (unique count is low) will have a low level of cardinality. Conversely, a column that has a lot of unique values in its range (unique count is high) will have a high level of cardinality.
Lower cardinality leads to more optimized performance, so you might need to reduce the number of high cardinality columns in your semantic model.

Reduce relationship cardinality
When you import multiple tables, it is possible that you'll do some analysis by using data from all those tables. Relationships between those tables are necessary to accurately calculate results and display the correct information in your reports. Power BI Desktop helps make creating those relationships easier. In fact, in most cases, you won't have to do anything, the autodetect feature does it for you. However, you might occasionally have to create relationships or need to make changes to a relationship. Regardless, it's important to understand relationships in Power BI Desktop and how to create and edit them.
When you create or edit a relationship, you can configure additional options. By default, Power BI Desktop automatically configures additional options based on its best guess, which can be different for each relationship based on the data in the columns.
The relationships can have different cardinality. Cardinality is the direction of the relationship, and each model relationship must be defined with a cardinality type. The cardinality options in Power BI are:
Many-to-one (*:1) - This relationship is the most common, default type. It means that the column in one table can have more than one instance of a value, and the other related table, often known as the lookup table, has only one instance of a value.
One-to-one (1:1) - In this relationship type, the column in one table has only one instance of a particular value, and the other related table has only one instance of a particular value.
One-to-many (1:*) - In this relationship type, the column in one table has only one instance of a particular value, and the other related table can have more than one instance of a value.
Many-to-many (:) - With composite models, you can establish a many-to-many relationship between tables, which removes requirements for unique values in tables. It also removes previous workarounds, such as introducing new tables only to establish relationships.
During development, you are creating and editing relationships in your model, so when you are building new relationships in your model, regardless of what cardinality you have chosen, always ensure that both of the columns that you are using to participate in a relationship are sharing the same data type. Your model will never work if you try to build a relationship between two columns, where one column has a text data type and another column has an integer data type.
In the following example, the ProductID field has the data type Whole number in the Product and Sales tables. The columns with data type Integer perform better than columns with data type Text.
