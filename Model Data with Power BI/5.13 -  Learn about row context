Now that you've created calculated columns, you can learn how their formulas are evaluated.
The formula for a calculated column is evaluated for each table row. Furthermore, it's evaluated within row context, which means the current row. Consider the Due Fiscal Year calculated column definition:

DAX
Due Fiscal Year =
"FY"
    & YEAR('Due Date'[Due Date])
        + IF(
            MONTH('Due Date'[Due Date]) <= 6,
            1
        )
