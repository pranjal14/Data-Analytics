You can write a DAX formula to add a calculated column to any table in your model. A calculated column formula must return a scalar or single value.
Calculated columns in import models have a cost: They increase the model storage size and they can prolong the data refresh time. The reason is because calculated columns recalculate when they have formula dependencies to refreshed tables.
In the data view, in the Fields pane, ensure that the Due Date table is selected. Before you create a calculated column, first rename the Date column to Due Date.
Now, you can add a calculated column to the Due Date table. To create a calculated column, in the Table tools contextual ribbon, from inside the Calculations group, select New column.
