It's unusual for a Power BI semantic model to be composed of a single table. A single-table model can be a simple design, perhaps one that's suitable for a data exploration task or proof of concept, but not one that's an optimal model design. An optimal model adheres to star schema design principles. Star schema refers to a design approach that's commonly used by relational data warehouse designers because it presents a user-friendly structure and it supports high-performance analytic queries.
This design principle is called a star schema because it classifies model tables as either fact or dimension. In a diagram, a fact table forms the center of a star, while dimension tables, when placed around a fact table, represent the points of the star.
