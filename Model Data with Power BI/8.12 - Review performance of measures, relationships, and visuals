If your semantic model has multiple tables, complex relationships, intricate calculations, multiple visuals, or redundant data, a potential exists for poor report performance. The poor performance of a report leads to a negative user experience.
To optimize performance, you must first identify where the problem is coming from; in other words, find out which elements of your report and semantic model are causing the performance issues. Afterward, you can take action to resolve those issues and, therefore, improve performance.

Identify report performance bottlenecks
To achieve optimal performance in your reports, you need to create an efficient semantic model that has fast running queries and measures. When you have a good foundation, you can improve the model further by analyzing the query plans and dependencies and then making changes to further optimize performance.
