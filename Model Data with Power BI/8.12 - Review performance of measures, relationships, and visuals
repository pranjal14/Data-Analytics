If your semantic model has multiple tables, complex relationships, intricate calculations, multiple visuals, or redundant data, a potential exists for poor report performance. The poor performance of a report leads to a negative user experience.
To optimize performance, you must first identify where the problem is coming from; in other words, find out which elements of your report and semantic model are causing the performance issues. Afterward, you can take action to resolve those issues and, therefore, improve performance.

Identify report performance bottlenecks
To achieve optimal performance in your reports, you need to create an efficient semantic model that has fast running queries and measures. When you have a good foundation, you can improve the model further by analyzing the query plans and dependencies and then making changes to further optimize performance.
You should review the measures and queries in your semantic model to ensure that you are using the most efficient way to get the results that you want. Your starting point should be to identify bottlenecks that exist in the code. When you identify the slowest query in the semantic model, you can focus on the biggest bottleneck first and establish a priority list to work through the other issues.

Analyze performance
You can use Performance analyzer in Power BI Desktop to help you find out how each of your report elements is performing when users interact with them. For example, you can determine how long it takes for a particular visual to refresh when it is initiated by a user interaction. Performance analyzer will help you identify the elements that are contributing to your performance issues, which can be useful during troubleshooting.
Before you run Performance analyzer, to ensure you get the most accurate results in your analysis (test), make sure that you start with a clear visual cache and a clear data engine cache.
Visual cache - When you load a visual, you can't clear this visual cache without closing Power BI Desktop and opening it again. To avoid any caching in play, you need to start your analysis with a clean visual cache.
To ensure that you have a clear visual cache, add a blank page to your Power BI Desktop (.pbix) file and then, with that page selected, save and close the file. Reopen the Power BI Desktop (.pbix) file that you want to analyze. It will open on the blank page.
Data engine cache - When a query is run, the results are cached, so the results of your analysis will be misleading. You need to clear the data cache before rerunning the visual.
To clear the data cache, you can either restart Power BI Desktop or connect DAX Studio to the semantic model and then call Clear Cache.
When you have cleared the caches and opened the Power BI Desktop file on the blank page, go to the View tab and select the Performance analyzer option.
To begin the analysis process, select Start recording, select the page of the report that you want to analyze, and interact with the elements of the report that you want to measure. You will see the results of your interactions displayed in the Performance analyzer pane as you work. When you are finished, select the Stop button.

Review results
You can review the results of your performance test in the Performance analyzer pane. To review the tasks in order of duration, longest to shortest, right-click the Sort icon next to the Duration (ms) column header, and then select Total time in Descending order.
The log information for each visual shows how much time it took (duration) to complete the following categories of tasks:
DAX query - The time it took for the visual to send the query, along with the time it took Analysis Services to return the results.
Visual display - The time it took for the visual to render on the screen, including the time required to retrieve web images or geocoding.
Other - The time it took the visual to prepare queries, wait for other visuals to complete, or perform other background processing tasks. If this category displays a long duration, the only real way to reduce this duration is to optimize DAX queries for other visuals, or reduce the number of visuals in the report.
The results of the analysis test help you to understand the behavior of your semantic model and identify the elements that you need to optimize. You can compare the duration of each element in the report and identify the elements that have a long duration. You should focus on those elements and investigate why it takes them so long to load on the report page.
To analyze your queries in more detail, you can use DAX Studio, which is a free, open-source tool that is provided by another service.

Resolve issues and optimize performance
The results of your analysis will identify areas for improvement and opportunities for performance optimization. You might find that you need to carry out improvements to the visuals, the DAX query, or other elements in your semantic model. The following information provides guidance on what to look for and the changes that you can make.
Visuals
If you identify visuals as the bottleneck leading to poor performance, you should find a way to improve performance with minimal impact to user experience.
Consider the number of visuals on the report page; fewer visuals means better performance. Ask yourself if a visual is really necessary and if it adds value to the end user. If the answer is no, you should remove that visual. Rather than using multiple visuals on the page, consider other ways to provide additional details, such as drill-through pages and report page tooltips.
Examine the number of fields in each visual. The more visuals you have on the report, the higher chance for performance issues. In addition, the more visuals, the more the report can appear crowded and lose clarity. The upper limit for visuals is 100 fields (measures or columns), so a visual with more than 100 fields will be slow to load. Ask yourself if you really need all of this data in a visual. You might find that you can reduce the number of fields that you currently use.
