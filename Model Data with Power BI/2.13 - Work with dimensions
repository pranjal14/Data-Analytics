When building a star schema, you will have dimension and fact tables. Fact tables contain information about events such as sales orders, shipping dates, resellers, and suppliers. Dimension tables store details about business entities, such as products or time, and are connected back to fact tables through a relationship.
You can use hierarchies as one source to help you find detail in dimension tables. These hierarchies form through natural segments in your data. For instance, you can have a hierarchy of dates in which your dates can be segmented into years, months, weeks, and days. Hierarchies are useful because they allow you to drill down into the specifics of your data instead of only seeing the data at a high level.
