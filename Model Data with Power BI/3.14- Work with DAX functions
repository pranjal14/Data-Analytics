The DAX function library consists of hundreds of functions, each designed to accomplish a specific goal.

Because DAX originated with the Power Pivot add-in for Microsoft Excel 2010, over 80 functions are available that can also be found in Excel. It was a deliberate design strategy by Microsoft to ensure that Excel users can quickly become productive with DAX.
However, many functions exist that you won't find in Excel because they're specific to data modeling:
Relationship navigation functions
Filter context modification functions
Iterator functions
Time intelligence functions
Path functions

Functions that originate from Excel
The following sections consider several useful functions that you might already be familiar with because they exist in Excel.
The IF DAX function tests whether a condition that's provided as the first argument is met. It returns one value if the condition is TRUE and returns the other value if the condition is FALSE. The function's syntax is:
IF(<logical_test>, <value_if_true>[, <value_if_false>])
If logical_test evaluates to FALSE and value_if_false isn't provided, the function will return BLANK.
Many Excel summarization functions are available, including SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, and many others. The only difference is that in DAX, you pass in a column reference, whereas in Excel, you pass in a range of cells.
Many Excel mathematic, text, date and time, information, and logical functions are available as well. For example, a small sample of Excel functions that are available in DAX include ABS, ROUND, SQRT, LEN, LEFT, RIGHT, UPPER, DATE, YEAR, MONTH, NOW, ISNUMBER, TRUE, FALSE, AND, OR, NOT, and IFERROR.

Functions that don't originate from Excel
Two useful DAX functions that aren't specific to modeling and that don't originate from Excel are DISTINCTCOUNT and DIVIDE.

DISTINCTCOUNT function
You can use the DISTINCTCOUNT DAX function to count the number of distinct values in a column. This function is especially powerful in an analytics solution. Consider that the count of customers is different from the count of distinct customers. The latter doesn't count repeat customers, so the difference is "How many customers" compared with "How many different customers."
