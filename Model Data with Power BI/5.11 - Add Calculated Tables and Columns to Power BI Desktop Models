Introduction

You can write a Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) formula to add a calculated table to your model. The formula can duplicate or transform existing model data to produce a new table.
 Note : A calculated table can't connect to external data; you must use Power Query to accomplish that task.
A calculated table formula must return a table object. The simplest formula can duplicate an existing model table.
Calculated tables have a cost: They increase the model storage size and they can prolong the data refresh time. The reason is because calculated tables recalculate when they have formula dependencies to refreshed tables.
