You can declare DAX variables in your formula expressions. When you declare at least one variable, a RETURN clause is used to define the expression, which then refers to the variables.

We recommend that you use variables because they offer several benefits:

Improving the readability and maintenance of your formulas.
Improving performance because variables are evaluated once and only when or if they're needed.
Allowing (at design time) straightforward testing of a complex formula by returning the variable of interest.
The following example shows a formula that declares a variable. The Revenue YoY % measure definition is rewritten to declare a variable that's assigned the value of the prior year's revenue.

Revenue YoY % =
VAR RevenuePriorYear =
    CALCULATE(
        [Revenue],
        SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])
    )
RETURN
    DIVIDE(
        [Revenue] - RevenuePriorYear,
        RevenuePriorYear
    )
