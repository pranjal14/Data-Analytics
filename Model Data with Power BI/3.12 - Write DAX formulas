Each model calculation type, calculated table, calculated column, or measure is defined by its name, followed by the equals symbol (=), which is then followed by a DAX formula. Use the following template to create a model calculation:
<Calculation name> = <DAX formula>
For example, the definition of the Ship Date calculated table that duplicates the Date table data is:
Ship Date = 'Date'
A DAX formula consists of expressions that return a result. The result is either a table object or a scalar value. Calculated table formulas must return a table object; calculated column and measure formulas must return a scalar value (single value).

Formulas are assembled by using:
DAX functions
DAX operators
References to model objects
Constant values, like the number 24 or the literal text "FY" (abbreviation for fiscal year)
DAX variables
Whitespace

DAX functions
Similar to Microsoft Excel, DAX is a functional language meaning that formulas rely on functions to accomplish specific goals. Typically, DAX functions have arguments that allow passing in variables. Formulas can use many function calls and will often nest functions within other functions.
In a formula, function names must be followed by parentheses. Within the parentheses, variables are passed in.

DAX operators
Formulas also rely on operators, which can perform arithmetic calculations, compare values, work with strings, or test conditions.

References to model objects
Formulas can only refer to three types of model objects: tables, columns, or measures. A formula can't refer to a hierarchy or a hierarchy level. (Recall that a hierarchy level is based on a column, so your formula can refer to a hierarchy level's column.)

Table references
When you reference a table in a formula, officially, the table name is enclosed within single quotation marks. In the following calculated table definition, notice that the Date table is enclosed within single quotation marks.
Ship Date = 'Date'
However, single quotation marks can be omitted when both of the following conditions are true:
The table name does not include embedded spaces.
The table name isn't a reserved word that's used by DAX. All DAX function names and operators are reserved words. Date is a DAX function name, which explains why, when you are referencing a table named Date, that you must enclose it within single quotation marks.
In the following calculated table definition, it's possible to omit the single quotation marks when referencing the Airport table:
Arrival Airport = Airport

Column references
When you reference a column in a formula, the column name must be enclosed within square brackets. Optionally, it can be preceded by its table name. For example, the following measure definition refers to the Sales Amount column.
Revenue = SUM([Sales Amount])
Because column names are unique within a table but not necessarily unique within the model, you can disambiguate the column reference by preceding it with its table name. This disambiguated column is known as a fully qualified column. Some DAX functions require passing in fully qualified columns.
The previous example measure definition can be rewritten as:
Revenue = SUM(Sales[Sales Amount])
