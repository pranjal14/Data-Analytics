Each model calculation type, calculated table, calculated column, or measure is defined by its name, followed by the equals symbol (=), which is then followed by a DAX formula. Use the following template to create a model calculation:
<Calculation name> = <DAX formula>
For example, the definition of the Ship Date calculated table that duplicates the Date table data is:
Ship Date = 'Date'
A DAX formula consists of expressions that return a result. The result is either a table object or a scalar value. Calculated table formulas must return a table object; calculated column and measure formulas must return a scalar value (single value).

Formulas are assembled by using:
DAX functions
DAX operators
References to model objects
Constant values, like the number 24 or the literal text "FY" (abbreviation for fiscal year)
DAX variables
Whitespace
