Each model calculation type, calculated table, calculated column, or measure is defined by its name, followed by the equals symbol (=), which is then followed by a DAX formula. Use the following template to create a model calculation:
<Calculation name> = <DAX formula>
For example, the definition of the Ship Date calculated table that duplicates the Date table data is:
Ship Date = 'Date'
A DAX formula consists of expressions that return a result. The result is either a table object or a scalar value. Calculated table formulas must return a table object; calculated column and measure formulas must return a scalar value (single value).

Formulas are assembled by using:
DAX functions
DAX operators
References to model objects
Constant values, like the number 24 or the literal text "FY" (abbreviation for fiscal year)
DAX variables
Whitespace

DAX functions
Similar to Microsoft Excel, DAX is a functional language meaning that formulas rely on functions to accomplish specific goals. Typically, DAX functions have arguments that allow passing in variables. Formulas can use many function calls and will often nest functions within other functions.
In a formula, function names must be followed by parentheses. Within the parentheses, variables are passed in.
