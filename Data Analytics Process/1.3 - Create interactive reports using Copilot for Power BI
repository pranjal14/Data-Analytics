In this module, you learn the concepts of using Copilot for Power BI to create reports efficiently, including how to create measures, design visuals, and build entire report pages. 
Prepare your data for use with Copilot for Power BI
Microsoft Power BI enables you to develop interactive reports within a single tool. Typical report development consists of the following steps:
Prepare and model data
Visualize and analyze data
Secure and distribute reports

You can reduce the amount of time spent creating reports by using Copilot for Power BI to perform certain tasks, such as:
Create measures based on natural language.
Update the semantic model with synonyms for improved user Q&A experience.
Generate report content, summary visuals, and pages from prepopulated prompts.
Analyze a summary of the underlying semantic model.
However, you still perform the initial data cleansing and transformation tasks, which are crucial to ensure accuracy in reporting.

Use Copilot for Power BI to model your data
Properly prepared data is the foundation for data insights. Once you clean, transform, and shape your data, you can start to design the semantic model.
Connect tables with relationships
Your next step is to create relationships between tables. Relationships allow you to filter and summarize data in report visuals later in the development process. You can use the autodetect relationships feature to get you started, then use Copilot to summarize the initial semantic model to determine if any other relationships are needed.
Create quick measures
Once your tables are connected, you might find that you're unable to answer the business requirement questions with the data as is. In this scenario, you can create measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create new data calculations to solve your requirements. DAX is versatile and powerful, but also daunting when getting started with Power BI. DAX is described as a functional language. Functional languages, like DAX, focus on using functions to compute results, which can be more counter-intuitive compared to the step-by-step approach of set-based languages.
Power BI allows you to create quick measures, which allow you to add the data fields you want to calculate.
Suggestions with Copilot
Quick measures are an excellent solution, but you might need an even simpler option when getting started. If you have access to Copilot for Power BI, you can also use the Suggestions with Copilot option in Quick measures. Copilot allows you to use a Q&A like experience where you can use natural language to describe what calculation you want to see.
With a single prompt, such as total sales by all products and a prepared semantic model, we can quickly see possible measures to add for new data insights.
Quick measures and Copilot allow you to create measures and learn DAX with minimal effort, while meeting your report requirements.
Query with DAX
There are four views in Power BI Desktop: Report, Table, Model, and DAX Query. In the DAX Query view, you can select Copilot in the ribbon and use natural language to describe what you want.
Consider the following prompt total sales for all salespeople individually for all items in the accessories category entered into the Copilot feature of DAX Query view.
This prompt is intending to calculate each individual salesperson's total sales for the accessories category. At AdventureWorks, there are multiple categories with multiple products within. Accessories have low sales, and the business requirement is to understand better who is selling more accessories, in case they can share valuable information.
Create measures from DAX queries
Use Copilot in DAX Query View to explore the data and determine which measures you need to create, and then select the Update model with changes to create the measures. The following query was generated from a suggested measures prompt.
The following screenshot is the result of three simple steps:
Enter the suggest measures prompt.
Select Keep query after results return.
Run the query.
As a report developer, you can Update model with changes to create the measures best suited to your project.
Summary
Copilot allows you to explore and design semantic models more efficiently, expanding your data analysis skills and making you a better report developer.

Create reports with Copilot for Power BI

Create reports with Power BI Desktop
Power BI Desktop is the primary report development tool. You can connect to, transform, model, and visualize data all from this application. Let's explore how Copilot can assist you in creating visuals and reports in Power BI Desktop.
The Copilot experience is consistent with other Microsoft Copilot products - select the Copilot button and a new pane opens with suggested prompts and chat capabilities.
Some of the prompts you can try are:
Create a new report page.
Suggest content for a new report page.
Answer this data question... (then insert your question in the chat).

The following example was generated by using the Create a new report page suggested prompt. Copilot asked for the name and description, and then created the report elements, including:
Header with slicers for product and salesperson.
Card visuals for the sums of sales, cost, and measure for profit (sales minus cost).
Area charts evaluating sales, cost, and profit over time.
Column charts evaluating sales, cost, and profit by product.
A Map visual for sales by region.
This report and all of the elements were generated in a consistent theme and created quickly.
