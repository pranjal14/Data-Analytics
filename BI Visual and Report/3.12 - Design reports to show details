An analytical report layout can integrate a guided analytical experience. That way, the report design is aligned to the automatic and unconscious processes that take place when the report consumer looks at the report.
The guided analytical experience allows navigation between three levels:
High-level metrics
Supporting visuals
Details, when required
You can show details by using four different techniques:
Use drillable visuals
Add tooltips
Add drillthrough
Embed paginated reports

Use drillable visuals
The simplest way to show details is to use drillable visuals. The matrix visual is an excellent choice because it allows drilling on rows and/or columns. Therefore, by assigning hierarchies or multiple fields, report consumers can drill to the level of detail that they want. For example, the matrix rows could show years, and the report consumer could drill down to quarter, month, and date levels.

Add tooltips
Adding tooltips is a simple way to reveal details or provide supporting metrics. In Power BI service, tooltips appear when the report consumer hovers the cursor over an element of a report object. An element could be a column of a column chart or a bubble or region in a map. In a mobile app, tooltips appear when consumers are using the tap-and-hold gesture.
Power BI reports support two types of tooltips: visual and page.

Visual tooltips
Many Power BI visuals include a Tooltips well. Fields that are added to this well are summarized in a tooltip. For example, a column chart visual that shows sales revenue by month could include order quantity as a tooltip. While the height of the column reveals the monthly revenue amount, when a report consumer hovers over the column, a tooltip describes the order quantity for that month.

Page tooltips
Page tooltips allow your report consumers to gain deeper insights quickly and efficiently from visuals. As its name suggests, a page tooltip is a report page that receives the filter context of the source element. In this way, they're closely related to drillthrough pages, with the difference being that the page tooltip overlays a small page of visuals
You can associate page tooltips with different report objects, such as:
Visuals - On a visual-by-visual basis, you can configure which visuals reveal your page tooltip. For each visual, you can have the visual reveal no tooltip, default to the visual tooltips (which is configured in a field well found in the Visualizations pane), or use a specific page tooltip.
Visual headers - You can configure specific visuals to display a page tooltip. Your report users can reveal the page tooltip when they hover the cursor over the visual header icon. Make sure that you educate your users about this icon.

Add drillthrough
Drillthrough navigates the report consumer to a different page, possibly in a different report, and it can show details. The main benefit of drillthrough is that you don't need to clutter a report page with details. Instead, the details are available when required.
A common use case for drillthrough is to allow report consumers to achieve the following flow:
View a report page.
Identify a visual element to analyze in depth.
Right-click the visual element to drill through.
Perform complimentary analysis.
Return to the source report page.
To enable drillthrough, you can create a report page that provides details. This design approach allows consumers to view supporting transactions and only when needed.
