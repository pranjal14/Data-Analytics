An analytical report layout can integrate a guided analytical experience. That way, the report design is aligned to the automatic and unconscious processes that take place when the report consumer looks at the report.
The guided analytical experience allows navigation between three levels:
High-level metrics
Supporting visuals
Details, when required
You can show details by using four different techniques:
Use drillable visuals
Add tooltips
Add drillthrough
Embed paginated reports
