An outlier is a type of anomaly in your data. It's something that you don't expect or that surprises you, based on historical averages or results. You should identify outliers to isolate data points that significantly differ from other data points, and then take action to investigate the reasons for the differences. This analysis can make a significant effect on business decision making.
