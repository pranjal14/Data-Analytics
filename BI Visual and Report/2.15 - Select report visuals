The primary goal of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and effectively to report consumers. Selecting the most effective visual type and layout to meet requirements is critical. Selecting the wrong visual type could make it difficult for report consumers to understand the data, or worse, it could result in the misrepresentation of the data.
Visual selection can be challenging because you have so many visuals to choose from. To help you select an appropriate visual, the following sections provide tips and guidance to help you meet specific visualization requirements.

Categorical visuals
Often, bar or column charts are good choices when you need to show data across multiple categories. Selecting which type depends on the number of categories and the kind of information that you want to visualize. For example, if many category values are available, you should avoid selecting a visual where color is used to split the data, such as a stacked bar chart with a category legend. Instead, use the category dimension on the axis of a bar chart.
Additionally, you should avoid a line chart with a categorical X-axis because the line implies a relationship between elements that might not exist. In the following example, notice that the line chart visual implies a relationship between the product categories on the X-axis.
In the next example, a bar chart shows sales by product category. Notice that the visual is sorted by sales values in descending order. Mostly, you should sort categorical charts by value rather than in alphabetical category order. Make sure that you determine the sort order (ascending or descending) by what you want to first draw attention to so that it provides the report consumer with an intuitive visual organized to produce a natural flow.

Time series visuals
Always use a line or column chart to show values over time. The X-axis should present time, sorted from earliest to latest periods (left to right).
Note
This placement applies to audiences who predominantly read left to right (LTR). When your audience reads right to left (RTL), as is the case with some written languages, sort the X-axis from right to left.
In the following example, a line chart shows historical sales. The line chart shows the natural flow of a timeline from left to right, eliminating the time needed to interpret the X-axis.
You can take the line chart to the next level by adding an analytics option. In this case, it applies a forecast to extend historical sales with projected sales.
Line charts work well with a consistent flow of data, such as when sales are recorded for every period. If no sales are recorded for some periods, the line chart visual will fill such gaps with a straight line that connects the values of the previous and next periods. If missing values are a possibility, a column chart might be a better visual choice because it helps to avoid the interpretation of a nonexistent trend.
The first chart is a line chart. The second chart is a column chart. The column chart has missing columns indicating no sales for those time periods.
Other Power BI core visuals that you can use for time series data include:
Stacked column chart
Area chart
Line and stacked column chart
Ribbon chart, which has the added benefit of showing rank changes over time

Proportional visuals
Proportional visuals show data as part of a whole. They effectively communicate how a value is distributed across a dimension. Column and bar chart visuals work well for visualizing proportions across multiple dimensions.
Note
Proportional visuals can't plot a mix of positive and negative values. They should be used when all values are positive or all values are negative.
