The primary goal of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and effectively to report consumers. Selecting the most effective visual type and layout to meet requirements is critical. Selecting the wrong visual type could make it difficult for report consumers to understand the data, or worse, it could result in the misrepresentation of the data.
Visual selection can be challenging because you have so many visuals to choose from. To help you select an appropriate visual, the following sections provide tips and guidance to help you meet specific visualization requirements.

Categorical visuals
Often, bar or column charts are good choices when you need to show data across multiple categories. Selecting which type depends on the number of categories and the kind of information that you want to visualize. For example, if many category values are available, you should avoid selecting a visual where color is used to split the data, such as a stacked bar chart with a category legend. Instead, use the category dimension on the axis of a bar chart.
Additionally, you should avoid a line chart with a categorical X-axis because the line implies a relationship between elements that might not exist. In the following example, notice that the line chart visual implies a relationship between the product categories on the X-axis.
In the next example, a bar chart shows sales by product category. Notice that the visual is sorted by sales values in descending order. Mostly, you should sort categorical charts by value rather than in alphabetical category order. Make sure that you determine the sort order (ascending or descending) by what you want to first draw attention to so that it provides the report consumer with an intuitive visual organized to produce a natural flow.
