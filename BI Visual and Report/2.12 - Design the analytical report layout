When report consumers look at a report, an automatic and unconscious process occurs when they comprehend what they see. Therefore, you should adhere to basic report design principles to support this process to help effectively communicate meaning from data.
Tip
Report design is a blend of science and art, and many possible report designs are available that help achieve the audience and interface requirements. What matters most is that the report design effectively communicates the data to meet requirements.
An analytical report can consist of one or more pages, and pages comprise report objects. Report objects can be data visuals, which represent query results, or decorations like images, background shapes, or text. You can begin to design a report layout by determining the number, sequence, and purpose of the pages. Make sure that you avoid combining subjects or opposing objectives on the same page. Then, design each page layout with specific report objects that are relevant to the requirements.
Additionally, good report design layouts should consider design principles of placement, balance, contrast, proximity, and repetition.
Tip
Always keep in mind that the less is more adage applies; simplicity and clarity lead to good design.

Placement
Good placement of report objects contributes to an ordered report design. Generally, you should place the most important information in the upper-left corner of the page and arrange the report elements from left to right and top to bottom.
Arrange report objects so that the vertical and horizontal edges align because it looks ordered and is pleasing to the eye. Organize related report objects into logical groups. An ordered report layout creates a connection between visual elements and avoids clutter that can result from a seemingly random placement of report objects.
Additionally, aligning report objects in a visually pleasing layout can convey more energy and interest than simply centering or randomly placing report objects. Consider applying the rule of thirds, which is a visual arts rule that can be applied to report object placements in an analytical report. The rule proposes that a page layout should be divided into an invisible grid of nine equal parts. The grid is two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines. Then, report objects can be placed within the cells of the grid.
At the Contoso Skateboard Store, a proposed report design for analyzing sales presents three equally sized vertical regions. The first region shows sales broken down by product, the second region shows sales broken down by customer store, and the third region shows sold items.
