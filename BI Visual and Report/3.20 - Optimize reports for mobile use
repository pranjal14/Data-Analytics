Some of your report users might want to view your reports on their mobile phone or tablet. While they can view any Power BI report page in landscape orientation, you might want to create another view that is optimized for mobile devices and displays in portrait orientation. Power BI gives you the power to use visuals that make sense for mobile users and rearrange those visuals in the most effective way.
When you have finished creating your report for the regular web view, you can then create a version of the report that's optimized for use on phones and tablets.
To create a mobile-optimized version of your report, you can:
Design a mobile layout view, where you can drag and drop certain visuals onto a phone emulator canvas.
Use visuals and slicers that are suitable for use on small, mobile screens.
To publish a mobile-optimized version of your report, you simply publish the report as you did previously. The web and mobile versions are published together at the same time.

Design a mobile report layout
To design the mobile-optimized view of a report page, start by opening the mobile layout view for that page. In Power BI Desktop, open the specific report page, select the View tab, and then select Mobile layout.
This selection results in showing a scrollable canvas shaped like a phone and a Visualizations pane that lists all visuals on the original report page. Each visual appears with its name (for easy identification) and a visibility indicator that's useful when you're working with bookmarks. The visibility indicator of a visual changes depending on the visibility status of the visual in the current state of the web report view.
To add a visual to the mobile layout canvas, drag the visual from the Visualizations pane to the phone canvas, or double-click the visual in the Visualization pane. You can then resize and reposition the visual in the same way that you would a report page. Repeat these steps to add other visuals to the mobile layout canvas.
