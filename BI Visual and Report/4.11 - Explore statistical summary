Data is often intertwined with statistics because statistics are one way in which you can explore your data. Statistics can show you the distribution of your data, help you to identify key takeaways and trends, and determine whether outliers exist.
A statistical summary provides a quick and simple description of your data. Power BI has many features that help you conduct a statistical analysis. Exploring the statistical summary gives the user a high-level view of the available data, where they can see clusters, patterns on behavioral data, data averages, and more. They can gain insights about their data that help drive business decisions.
For example, the Supply Chain team asks you to create a report that shows the frequency of orders for certain products and what the top 10 products are in terms of sales.

Statistical functions
Power BI supports many Data Analytics Expressions (DAX) functions that you can use to get quick statistics based on your data. You can access these quick functions by right-clicking a summarizable field assigned to the well of a visual in the Visualizations pane, as illustrated in the following image.
However, to avoid performance issues, it's better to create the statistical measures yourself by using an expression written in DAX. For example, to analyze the average order quantity for each product, you could create the following measure:
Average Qty =
AVERAGE ( Sales[Order Qty] )
