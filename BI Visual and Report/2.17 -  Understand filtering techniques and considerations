Some report filtering techniques apply at design time, while others are relevant at report consumption time (in reading view). This unit describes filtering techniques that allow report consumers to intuitively narrow down to the data points that interest them.
Other filtering techniques
Beyond filters and slicers, report authors can employ other filtering techniques, such as:
Visual interactions
Drillthrough
Report tooltip
Bookmarks
Report options
Query reduction options
