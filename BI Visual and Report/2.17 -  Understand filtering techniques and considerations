Some report filtering techniques apply at design time, while others are relevant at report consumption time (in reading view). This unit describes filtering techniques that allow report consumers to intuitively narrow down to the data points that interest them.
Other filtering techniques
Beyond filters and slicers, report authors can employ other filtering techniques, such as:
Visual interactions
Drillthrough
Report tooltip
Bookmarks
Report options
Query reduction options
Visual interactions
By default, when report consumers interact with visuals, filters are propagated to other visuals on the report page. This way, visuals behave like slicers. For example, a report consumer can select a column of a column chart visual to filter other visuals on the page. To remove the cross filters, they can either select the column again or select a different visual.
Tip
While cross filtering, you can introduce more cross filters, even from other visuals, by pressing the Ctrl key.
Cross filtering (and cross highlighting) works between any two visuals. However, at design time, you can edit visual interactions between any pair of visuals and in either direction. Additionally, you can disable cross filtering or modify the interaction to use cross highlighting instead.
To gain a better understanding of visual interactions, watch the following video that describes a use case and shows how to configure it.

Drillthrough
Add drillthrough pages to allow report consumers to drill from visuals. By default, the drillthrough action propagates all filters that apply to the visual to the drillthrough page.

Report tooltip
Add report tooltips that will appear when report consumers hover the cursor over visuals. By default, the report tooltip receives all filters that apply to the visual.

Bookmarks
Bookmarks capture a specific view of a report, including filters, slicers, the page selection, and the state of visuals. Report authors and report consumers can create them.
Note
Report consumers can also create bookmarks known as personal bookmarks.
Because bookmarks can capture filter state and when invoked they apply that filter state. You can invoke bookmarks directly from the Bookmarks pane, or you can invoke them indirectly by selecting a button, image, or shape.
You can create a bookmark to capture the default state of slicers. A button on the report page could have the text Reset slicers, and when invoked, it uses the bookmark.
