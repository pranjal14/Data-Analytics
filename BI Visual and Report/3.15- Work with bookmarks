Bookmarks are a powerful way to turn a Power BI report into a guided analytical experience. Bookmarks can also help maximize available page space and provide user-friendly interactions. The possibilities are nearly endless, spanning from simple outcomes, such as resetting filters, to more complex behaviors that swap visuals or navigate visual depth.
Commonly, you add buttons to a report design and configure their actions to apply a bookmark. Shapes and images can also apply bookmarks.
To understand what you can achieve with bookmarks, you need to know how to configure them. You can configure the state that they capture and the scope of visuals that they affect.

Bookmark state
Bookmarks capture different state, relating to data, display, and the current page. By default, a new bookmark captures all state types, but you can decide to disable any of them.
The Data state captures anything that impacts the queries that Power BI sends to the semantic model. For example, if a slicer is included in the scope of the bookmark, the Data state retains the applied slicer items when the bookmark was created (or last updated). It also captures sort order and the drill depth of a visual because the query is impacted.
The Display state is related to the visibility of a report object. Objects consist of visuals and also elements like text boxes, buttons, shapes, and images. By using the Selection pane, you can hide or unhide objects and groups of objects. Additionally, you can swap visuals on a report page by creating bookmarks that capture hidden and unhidden objects.
The Current page state determines whether the bookmark directs the report consumer to the bookmarked page or apply the current page. Disabling the Current page state is rare, but you should consider some creative use cases. For example, on a page tooltip, a bookmark can change the visuals without navigating from the page that the report consumer selected.

Bookmark scope
Bookmarks can apply to all page visuals or specific visuals that you select.
The All visuals scope is turned on by default, meaning that the bookmark applies to all report objects, even if hidden.
The Selected visuals scope targets only those visuals that are selected when the bookmark was updated.
Tip
Press the Ctrl key to select multiple visuals. The simplest way to select multiple visuals is to use the Selection pane. Also, when you're creating a selected visuals bookmark that shows/hides several objects, create a group of those objects and configure visibility for the group. That way, you can add or remove objects from the group without the need to update the bookmark.

Reset slicers
You can provide a simple way for report consumers to quickly reset slicers to a default state by following these steps:
Configure the bookmark to capture the Data state.
Configure the bookmark to use the Selected visuals scope, targeting the slicers that you want to reset. The Selected visuals scope is key because you don't want to affect other slicers or visuals. For example, if a drillable visual is on the page, the bookmark shouldn't overwrite the drill state when it resets the slicers.
Set the slicers to the default values.
Update the bookmark.
Assign the bookmark to a button action.
