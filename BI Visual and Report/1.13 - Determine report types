Generally, report design can be classified by report type. Often, a direct mapping between the report audience and the report type occurs. Audience needs can be met by one, or possibly a combination, of four report types:
Dashboard
Analytical
Operational
Educational
Commonly, executives work with dashboards, analysts work with analytical reports, and information workers work with operational reports.
Each report type has a different approach to the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) requirements. These requirements are described in more detail later in this module.
