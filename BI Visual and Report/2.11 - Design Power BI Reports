Introduction
You can design Microsoft Power BI reports in Power BI Desktop or the online Power BI service. Power BI mobile apps don't support report design; they support only the report consumer experience.
Note
Power BI Desktop is only supported on Windows operating systems. As a design tool, it also supports the development of reports and semantic models. In this module, the focus is only on report design.
