Introduction
You can design Microsoft Power BI reports in Power BI Desktop or the online Power BI service. Power BI mobile apps don't support report design; they support only the report consumer experience.
Note
Power BI Desktop is only supported on Windows operating systems. As a design tool, it also supports the development of reports and semantic models. In this module, the focus is only on report design.

Report structure
Structurally, a Power BI report connects to a single semantic model, and it has at least one report page. However, reports commonly have multiple pages. On each page, report objects are laid out. Report objects include:
Visuals - Visualizations of semantic model data.
Elements - Provide visual interest but don't use semantic model data. Elements include text boxes, buttons, shapes, and images.

Report pages
Similar to Microsoft Excel worksheets, you can add, rename, reorder, hide, duplicate, or delete Power BI report pages.
