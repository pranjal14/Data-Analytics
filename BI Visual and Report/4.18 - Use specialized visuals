Power BI includes several specialized visuals that provide considerable interactive experiences for report consumers. Often, these specialized visuals are called AI visuals because Power BI uses machine learning to discover insights from data. These visuals provide a simple way to deliver rich and interactive experiences to your report consumers.
The three main AI visuals are:
Key influencers
Decomposition tree
Q&A

Tip
When adding an AI visual to your report, make sure that you size it to become as large as possible. That way, report consumers can fully interact with, and explore, the data in the visual.

Key influencers
The Key influencers visual helps report consumers understand the factors that drive a particular metric, like sales revenue. By using AI, Power BI analyzes the data, ranks the factors that matter, and then presents them as key influencers.
In the following example, the visual helps report consumers understand the important factors that contribute to won sales opportunities. According to the visual, when the discount rate increases by 2 percent, the likelihood of a won sales opportunity increases by a factor of 2.76.
The Key influencers visual is many visuals inside one frame. When you select a key influencer, an adjacent visual displays a representation of the influencer as a comparison against the remainder of the data. Additionally, the Key influencers visual includes the Top segments view, which shows the highest-ranking segments that contribute to a particular metric.

Decomposition tree
The Decomposition Tree visual helps report consumers visualize data across multiple dimensions. It automatically aggregates data and enables consumers to drill down into dimensions in any order. As a result, it's a valuable tool for exploration and conducting root cause analysis. As an AI visual, a decomposition tree provides a guided exploration experience that helps by finding the next dimension for consumers to drill down into.
