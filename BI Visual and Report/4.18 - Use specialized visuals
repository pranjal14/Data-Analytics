Power BI includes several specialized visuals that provide considerable interactive experiences for report consumers. Often, these specialized visuals are called AI visuals because Power BI uses machine learning to discover insights from data. These visuals provide a simple way to deliver rich and interactive experiences to your report consumers.
The three main AI visuals are:
Key influencers
Decomposition tree
Q&A

Tip
When adding an AI visual to your report, make sure that you size it to become as large as possible. That way, report consumers can fully interact with, and explore, the data in the visual.

Key influencers
The Key influencers visual helps report consumers understand the factors that drive a particular metric, like sales revenue. By using AI, Power BI analyzes the data, ranks the factors that matter, and then presents them as key influencers.
