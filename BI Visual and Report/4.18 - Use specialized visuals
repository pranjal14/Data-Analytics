Power BI includes several specialized visuals that provide considerable interactive experiences for report consumers. Often, these specialized visuals are called AI visuals because Power BI uses machine learning to discover insights from data. These visuals provide a simple way to deliver rich and interactive experiences to your report consumers.
The three main AI visuals are:
Key influencers
Decomposition tree
Q&A

Tip
When adding an AI visual to your report, make sure that you size it to become as large as possible. That way, report consumers can fully interact with, and explore, the data in the visual.

Key influencers
The Key influencers visual helps report consumers understand the factors that drive a particular metric, like sales revenue. By using AI, Power BI analyzes the data, ranks the factors that matter, and then presents them as key influencers.
In the following example, the visual helps report consumers understand the important factors that contribute to won sales opportunities. According to the visual, when the discount rate increases by 2 percent, the likelihood of a won sales opportunity increases by a factor of 2.76.
The Key influencers visual is many visuals inside one frame. When you select a key influencer, an adjacent visual displays a representation of the influencer as a comparison against the remainder of the data. Additionally, the Key influencers visual includes the Top segments view, which shows the highest-ranking segments that contribute to a particular metric.

Decomposition tree
The Decomposition Tree visual helps report consumers visualize data across multiple dimensions. It automatically aggregates data and enables consumers to drill down into dimensions in any order. As a result, it's a valuable tool for exploration and conducting root cause analysis. As an AI visual, a decomposition tree provides a guided exploration experience that helps by finding the next dimension for consumers to drill down into.
In the following example, a Decomposition Tree visual helps report consumers to understand the breakdown of sales opportunity revenue.
For a demonstration of the Decomposition Tree visual, watch the following video. The lock icon next to the Prod Category split means that the report author added the split and set it so that it can't be removed. Additionally, the light bulb icon next to the Region split means that the report consumer used an AI split to discover the best split.

Q&A
The Q&A visual allows report consumers to ask questions of their data and receive responses as data visualizations. Similar to how web search engines parse and understand complex search requests, report consumers can write natural language questions (in English).
Tip
To optimize the Q&A experience, ensure that the data field names are user-friendly. You can also enhance the semantic model with synonyms and terms. Additionally, you can hide fields, such as fields that are used in model relationships, to restrict their use in Q&A. You can also add suggested questions that become prompts in the Q&A visual.

Summary
In this module, you learned about the emerging power of advanced analytics and discovered how the advanced analytics capabilities of Power BI can bring value the decision making and strategy formulation of your organization.
You enhanced the reports and dashboard to enable your organization to ask more questions and find more information that's specific to their teams and work contexts. You used Power BI to explore your data and create a statistical summary to find key takeaways and trends and identify outliers that might require immediate action. You conducted a time series analysis of your data to see how your data progressed over time so that you could make observations and forecast behavior.
Additionally, you used the Analyze feature to get Power BI to explain the increases and show you where the distribution was different in your data. You built upon the standard visuals in your report by adding custom visuals that helped you solve business problems and display data in more enhanced, animated ways. Then, you returned to Power BI to check for quick insights in your data to find more useful insights that you could add to your dashboards. Lastly, you used the grouping, binning, and clustering techniques to segment and present your data in different ways.
The advanced analytical techniques that you applied to your data enabled you to gain new insights from that data, and further scrutinize the data to uncover patterns, trends, and outliers that you didn't know existed. The results of your advanced analysis empower your organization to make more robust business decisions, plans, and forecasts.
