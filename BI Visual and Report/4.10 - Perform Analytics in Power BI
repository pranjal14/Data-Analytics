Big data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) focus on predictive capabilities to solve business problems. These advanced analytics methods enable organizations to make data-driven decisions and uncover new opportunities.
Analytics can transform raw data into an extensive collection of information that categorizes data to identify and analyze behavioral data and patterns. Organizations can use this information to analyze the current state of their operations and to predict future behavior and trends by asking "what-if" questions. Additionally, analytics can help with fraud detection, image recognition, sentiment analysis, overall general employee productivity, and it also often replaces cumbersome manual processes.
Consider a scenario where you ask an employee to determine the cause of a recent spike in sales. The employee might have to painstakingly inspect each sale, interview customers, talk to sales people, and examine market trends. Instead, you can use the Key Influencers visual, which uses advanced analytics, to get a faster explanation. The visual is only as good as the data that you give it, meaning you still have to collect the data and organize it. The actual analytics, however, can be done for you or at least give you an excellent start.
