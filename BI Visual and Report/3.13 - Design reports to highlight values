Highlighting values in reports helps to quickly communicate important and relevant facts about data. Power BI supports several techniques to highlight values:
Conditional formatting
Overlaid analytics
Anomaly detection
Specialized visuals

Conditional formatting
You can use conditional formatting to format table and matrix visuals. With this approach, you can apply rules to highlight specific cells by using:
Background color
Font color
Data bars
Icons

Overlaid analytics
You can also overlay analytics to highlight values. Certain visuals, like the line chart visual, allow you to add analytic options. Options include trend lines, constant lines, minimum or maximum lines, and many others.

Anomaly detection
When a time series (date field) is on the X-axis, two other analytic options are available. These options use AI to produce a forecast or find anomalies. The anomaly detection feature can help you highlight exceptional values.
The following example shows a line chart visual. Power BI detected an anomaly on a particular date and marked it with a shape. When the report consumer hovers the cursor over the shape, a tooltip appears that describes expected values.
Select the anomaly shape to open the Anomalies pane, which lists a series of visuals that provide further possible explanations.
