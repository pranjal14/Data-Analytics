When you've finished creating your report, you should give consideration to its performance. Performance relates to how quickly visualizations on the report page can load. You should test your report in the Power BI service to see how it works from the perspective of the user. If you experience poor performance, or if report users have reported issues, you should investigate the cause of those issues and take steps to tune the report for more optimized performance.
