Report filtering is a complex topic because many techniques are available for filtering a report. However, with complexity comes control, allowing you to design reports that meet requirements and expectations. This unit introduces filtering capabilities and describes the techniques you can apply to your report at design time.
Introduction to report filtering
Filtering can occur at five different levels of a report:
Semantic model, with row-level security (RLS)
Report
Page
Visual
Measure
Report, page, and visual level filters apply to the structure of the report.

Semantic model
Every report queries a single semantic model, which must be a semantic model. The semantic model can enforce row-level security (RLS) to restrict access to a subset of data, and different users see different data. A report can't determine whether the semantic model enforces RLS, and it can't override RLS.

Report structure
The structure of a report is hierarchical. The structure of the report is as follows:
The top level is the report.
The second level comprises its pages.
The third level comprises report objects, which consist of visuals and elements.
In the Filters pane, you can add a filter to any of these levels.

Measure
Measures are calculations created to summarize data in the semantic model. Measure formulas, which are written in Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), can modify filter context by using the CALCULATE or CALCULATETABLE function. These functions are powerful and provide you with the flexibility to add, remove, or modify filters and relationships. A set of DAX functions, known as time intelligence functions, also modify filter context. These functions can override any filters that are applied to the report structure.
At report design time (only in Power BI Desktop), you can create measures. These measures belong to the report, and so they're called report-level measures.
A good example of a measure that overrides report filters is a three-month moving average calculation. To compute the result for March, the filter context for month must expand to encompass January, February, and March. The CALCULATE function or a time intelligence function can modify the filter context to produce the desired result.
