Report filtering is a complex topic because many techniques are available for filtering a report. However, with complexity comes control, allowing you to design reports that meet requirements and expectations. This unit introduces filtering capabilities and describes the techniques you can apply to your report at design time.
Introduction to report filtering
Filtering can occur at five different levels of a report:
Semantic model, with row-level security (RLS)
Report
Page
Visual
Measure
Report, page, and visual level filters apply to the structure of the report.

Semantic model
Every report queries a single semantic model, which must be a semantic model. The semantic model can enforce row-level security (RLS) to restrict access to a subset of data, and different users see different data. A report can't determine whether the semantic model enforces RLS, and it can't override RLS.

Report structure
The structure of a report is hierarchical. The structure of the report is as follows:
The top level is the report.
The second level comprises its pages.
The third level comprises report objects, which consist of visuals and elements.
In the Filters pane, you can add a filter to any of these levels.

Measure
Measures are calculations created to summarize data in the semantic model. Measure formulas, which are written in Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), can modify filter context by using the CALCULATE or CALCULATETABLE function. These functions are powerful and provide you with the flexibility to add, remove, or modify filters and relationships. A set of DAX functions, known as time intelligence functions, also modify filter context. These functions can override any filters that are applied to the report structure.
At report design time (only in Power BI Desktop), you can create measures. These measures belong to the report, and so they're called report-level measures.
A good example of a measure that overrides report filters is a three-month moving average calculation. To compute the result for March, the filter context for month must expand to encompass January, February, and March. The CALCULATE function or a time intelligence function can modify the filter context to produce the desired result.
To gain a better understanding of report filtering, watch the following video that describes filter techniques at design time and consumption time.

Apply filters to the report structure
At report design time, use the Filters pane to apply filters to the report structure.
The Filters pane has three sections:
Filters on all pages
Filters on this page
Filters on this visual
The Filters on all pages section defines report-level filters, which apply to all report pages and visuals. Consider that report-level filters are global filters.
The Filters on this page section defines page-level filters, which apply to all visuals on a specific page, adding to any existing report-level filters. For example, if a report-level filter restricts data to the country/region of United States, and a page-level filter restricts data to the state of Washington, then both filters are in effect: Country/region is United States and State-Province is Washington.
The Filters on this visual section defines visual-level filters. This section is only visible when one visual is in focus because visual-level filters apply only to a single visual; they add to any existing report-level and page-level filters. Continuing the previous example, if a visual-level filter restricts data to the city of Seattle, then three filters are in effect: Country/region is United States, State-Province is Washington, and City is Seattle.
Unlike report and page-level filters, a visual-level filter can filter by using a measure. When a measure filters a visual, it's used to eliminate groups. For example, consider a column chart visual that groups by store. A measure filter could eliminate groups (stores) where the total store sales are less than a certain amount.
Filters apply to a single field and use one of following filter types:
Basic
Advanced, which allows you to create more complex conditions by using data type-specific operators
Top N
Relative date and Relative time
You can lock filters to ensure that report consumers can't remove or modify them. It's a good idea to lock filters that are critical to the design of the report, page, or visual. Additionally, you can hide filters. A hidden filter isn't visible to report consumers. Consider hiding a filter when the report consumer doesn't need to know about it, such as when filters are cleaning up the data, perhaps by removing BLANKs.
You can hide the entire Filters pane to ensure that report consumers can't open it.
