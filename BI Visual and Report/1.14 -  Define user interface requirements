UI requirements relate to how reports are consumed and to the appearance and behavior of reports. Aspects to consider include form factor, input method, style and theme, and accessibility.
Form factor
In the context of report design, form factor describes the size of the hardware that is used to open reports, and to page orientation (portrait or landscape).
