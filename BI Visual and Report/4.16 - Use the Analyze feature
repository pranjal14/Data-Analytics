The Analyze feature provides you with further analysis that's generated by Power BI for a selected data point in a visual. You might use this feature to see if Power BI found something new or to gain new insights into your data. This feature is useful for analyzing why your data distribution looks the way that it does.
Note
This feature doesn't work if you have non-numeric filters applied to your visual and/or you have measure filters applied.
