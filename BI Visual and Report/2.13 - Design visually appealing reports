Having the correct data and selecting appropriate visuals is important. Equally as important is ensuring that the report is visually appealing. A well-designed report should guide the report consumer to quickly find and understand the answers to their questions.
While you strive to produce an appealing report, bear in mind that the report should be user-friendly. Moreover, it might be possible to add more visuals to a well-designed report page without it appearing cluttered.
Space
Space is essential for an effective report design because it helps reduce clutter and increase readability. Spacing applies to the report page margins and the spacing between report objects.

Margins
Margins include the border area, or edge, around each page. Having a consistently spaced border area frames the report objects.
Because there isn't a report page property to set margins, it's up to you to lay out objects in way that results in a consistent border area. Margin sizes should be equal on both sides, with possible variation on the top and bottom. Space across the top or bottom can show branding, titles, slicers, or other information that needs to be separated from the visuals.

Object spacing
Ensure that you provide sufficient space surrounding, or within, report objects.

Note
When visual headers are enabled, be sure to test that they don't overlap with nearby objects. Overlapping objects can make interacting with visual header icons difficult. Adequate spacing between visuals helps you avoid this problem.
Consider using different space depth to visually separate sections of related objects. However, keep in mind that too much space can result in an unbalanced report layout and could draw the attention of the report consumer away from what matters. Moderation is key: Always strive to produce an evenly spaced and balanced report.
