Having the correct data and selecting appropriate visuals is important. Equally as important is ensuring that the report is visually appealing. A well-designed report should guide the report consumer to quickly find and understand the answers to their questions.
While you strive to produce an appealing report, bear in mind that the report should be user-friendly. Moreover, it might be possible to add more visuals to a well-designed report page without it appearing cluttered.
Space
Space is essential for an effective report design because it helps reduce clutter and increase readability. Spacing applies to the report page margins and the spacing between report objects.
