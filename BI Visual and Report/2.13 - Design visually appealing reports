Having the correct data and selecting appropriate visuals is important. Equally as important is ensuring that the report is visually appealing. A well-designed report should guide the report consumer to quickly find and understand the answers to their questions.
While you strive to produce an appealing report, bear in mind that the report should be user-friendly. Moreover, it might be possible to add more visuals to a well-designed report page without it appearing cluttered.
Space
Space is essential for an effective report design because it helps reduce clutter and increase readability. Spacing applies to the report page margins and the spacing between report objects.

Margins
Margins include the border area, or edge, around each page. Having a consistently spaced border area frames the report objects.
Because there isn't a report page property to set margins, it's up to you to lay out objects in way that results in a consistent border area. Margin sizes should be equal on both sides, with possible variation on the top and bottom. Space across the top or bottom can show branding, titles, slicers, or other information that needs to be separated from the visuals.

Object spacing
Ensure that you provide sufficient space surrounding, or within, report objects.

Note
When visual headers are enabled, be sure to test that they don't overlap with nearby objects. Overlapping objects can make interacting with visual header icons difficult. Adequate spacing between visuals helps you avoid this problem.
Consider using different space depth to visually separate sections of related objects. However, keep in mind that too much space can result in an unbalanced report layout and could draw the attention of the report consumer away from what matters. Moderation is key: Always strive to produce an evenly spaced and balanced report.

Size
Size can relate to page size and visual size.

Page size
You can set the page size to predefined or custom dimensions. Additionally, you can set custom dimensions that are larger than the available screen size so that the report consumer needs to interact with scrollbars to view the entire page.However, a large page size that is filled with visuals might take time to render, and visuals might not render in a top-to-bottom order.

Visual size
Generally, the more important the visual, the larger its size. Report consumers quickly focus on larger visuals. When similar visuals are on the page, such as a series of card visuals, they should be equally sized.
Many visuals are responsive to size, so the visual looks appealing in either a small or large size. However, consider that a line chart visual might appear like a sparkline when small in size. In this case, only a few axis and data labels might appear. When the line chart visual is sized larger, more detail is revealed, including many more axis and data labels.
While report consumers can use focus mode to enlarge a single visual, the visual should still clearly communicate its data when viewed at actual size on the report page. Focus mode can help consumers better interpret the data or more easily interact with the visual, such as expanding into levels of a matrix or decomposition tree visual.

Alignment
When multiple visuals are on the report page, ensure that they're properly aligned, meaning that the edges of visuals should be in alignment and the spacings between visuals are consistent.
Alignment also relates to format options. For example, the alignment of titles and legends within visuals should be consistent.
Consider laying out the report page with different sections and aligning visuals appropriately within the sections. Sections can be implied or explicit.

Implied sections
An implied section aligns groups of visuals in close proximity. The following example shows how spacing separates the visuals. This example demonstrates how well-applied spacing (highlighted with dashed lines) can convey association, and guide the attention of the report consumer while providing balance and structure to the report page.

Explicit sections
An explicit section uses colored shapes and overlays aligned visuals on those shapes. The following example shows how the colored background shapes and spacing (highlighted with shading) separate the visuals into three sections.
