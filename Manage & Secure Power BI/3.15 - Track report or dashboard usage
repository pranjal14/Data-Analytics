Organizations often need to distribute reports and dashboards effectively to ensure that critical insights reach the right audience at the right time. For example, a retail company might use subscriptions to send sales performance dashboards to store managers daily, while also monitoring usage metrics to identify which reports are most valuable to their teams.
Subscribe to a report or dashboard
Subscribing to a report or dashboard in Power BI allows users to stay informed about critical data and insights without needing to manually check for updates. By setting up subscriptions, users can receive regular email updates containing snapshots or attachments of reports or dashboards, ensuring they remain up-to-date with the latest information.
The subscription process is straightforward and highly customizable. In Power BI service, navigate to the report or dashboard and select the Subscribe option from the menu bar. Users can define the frequency of updates, such as hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, and specify the time of delivery. Additionally, subscriptions can include a preview image, a link to the report or dashboard, and even attachments in formats like PDF or PowerPoint for reports hosted in Premium capacity workspaces. This flexibility ensures that users receive the information in a format and schedule that best suits their needs.
