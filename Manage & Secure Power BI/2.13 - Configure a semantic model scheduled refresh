The Scheduled refresh feature in Power BI allows you to define the frequency and time slots to refresh a particular dataset. Scheduling the refresh of your data will save you time because you don't have to manually refresh the data. It also ensures that users can access the most up-to-date data.
In this example, you are creating a report, but then realize that the version of the employee data that you're using isn't the most up to date. You check the refresh status and notice that it was last refreshed some time ago, and no refresh is scheduled to take place.
