Unit 1 - Introduction

When your semantic models are published to your organization's workspace in Microsoft Power BI service, everyone who needs access to those semantic models can find them in a central location, which provides opportunities for collaboration between teams. It also reduces the duplication of effort because one semantic model can be used by multiple users for different business reasons. For instance, one semantic model can be used to create multiple Power BI reports. Because preparing and cleaning data can be time-consuming, sharing semantic models can be a productivity boost for report authors.
Effective management of semantic models is crucial for organizational performance. Automating refresh processes ensures users always have up-to-date data, while promoting key models helps users identify the best options. Parameters can enhance decision-making by enabling tasks like configuring incremental refreshes or running "what-if" scenarios. Additionally, maintaining a reliable gateway for accessing on-premises data from the cloud is essential, as connectivity issues can disrupt productivity and decision-making. Proactive preparation for such issues is vital to minimize their impact.
