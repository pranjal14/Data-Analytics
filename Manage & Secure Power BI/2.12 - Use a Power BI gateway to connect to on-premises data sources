A Power BI Gateway is a bridge that connects on-premises data sources to Power BI, Power Automate, Power Apps, and other Microsoft cloud services. On-premises data sources are those that aren't stored in the cloud. It enables secure data transfer between on-premises systems and Microsoft cloud services without moving the data to the cloud.
Two types of on-premises gateways are:
Standard mode - Allows multiple users to connect to multiple on-premises data sources and is suitable for complex scenarios.
Personal mode - Allows one user to connect to data sources. This type of gateway can only be used with Power BI. It can't be shared with other users, making it suitable for situations where you're the sole report creator in your organization. You'll install the gateway on your local computer, which needs to stay online for the gateway to work.
Note
We won't cover virtual network (VNet) data gateways in this module. VNet data gateways are used to connect to Azure Virtual Networks and are typically used in more complex scenarios.

Use an on-premises gateway
Before you can connect to your on-premises data source, you need to install the on-premises data gateway, and then configure it to suit your organizational needs. An admin in your organization usually completes this task.
When the on-premises gateway is installed and configured on a server, the admin starts the gateway and then signs in using a Microsoft 365 organization account.
When you're working in the cloud and interacting with an element that is connected to an on-premises data source, the following actions occur:

The cloud service creates a query and the encrypted credentials for the on-premises data source. The query and credentials are sent to the gateway queue for processing.
The gateway cloud service analyzes the query and pushes the request to Microsoft Azure Service Bus.
Service Bus sends the pending requests to the gateway.
The gateway gets the query, decrypts the credentials, and then connects to one or more data sources with those credentials.
The gateway sends the query to the data source to be run.
The results are sent from the data source back to the gateway and then to the cloud service. The service then uses the results.
