You've likely had the chance to load and transform data from numerous sources, build visuals, create measures, and even publish a report or two to Microsoft Power BI. The next step on your data analysis journey is to share these reports with a wider audience in your organization. This is where the Power BI service comes into play.
What is the Power BI service?
In a typical Power BI workflow, you begin by building a report in Power BI Desktop, then publishing it to the Power BI service. It's the Software as a Service (SaaS) part of Power BI and can be accessed through a web browser (https://app.powerbi.com). The Power BI service lets you consume and interact with reports, as well as individual visual elements found in those reports, right from your browser.
The Power BI service is composed of many building blocks, including workspaces, reports, semantic models, dashboards, and apps. Each of these components play a unique role in the Power BI ecosystem.
