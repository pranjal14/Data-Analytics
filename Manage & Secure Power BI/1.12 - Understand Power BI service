You've likely had the chance to load and transform data from numerous sources, build visuals, create measures, and even publish a report or two to Microsoft Power BI. The next step on your data analysis journey is to share these reports with a wider audience in your organization. This is where the Power BI service comes into play.
What is the Power BI service?
In a typical Power BI workflow, you begin by building a report in Power BI Desktop, then publishing it to the Power BI service. It's the Software as a Service (SaaS) part of Power BI and can be accessed through a web browser (https://app.powerbi.com). The Power BI service lets you consume and interact with reports, as well as individual visual elements found in those reports, right from your browser.
The Power BI service is composed of many building blocks, including workspaces, reports, semantic models, dashboards, and apps. Each of these components play a unique role in the Power BI ecosystem.

Workspaces
Workspaces are spaces for your Power BI content. They allow you to organize and manage your reports, semantic models, and dashboards. Workspaces can be created for different teams or projects within your organization, enabling collaboration and sharing of Power BI content.
Depending on the license mode, workspaces offer different levels of sharing, performance, and advanced features such as AI capabilities and higher refresh rates.

Reports
Once a report designer publishes a report to a Power BI workspace, the report becomes available to other users in that workspace. Users can then view it in their browser and interact with the visuals, and create their own reports based on the same semantic model.
A report has one or more pages, each containing one or more visuals. Presenting data as visuals makes it easier to grasp the meaning of what you're seeing. And, the visuals aren't static. You interact with the visuals and filters as you dig into the data to discover insights and find answers.

Semantic models
Power BI semantic models represent a source of data that's ready for reporting and visualization. When publishing a report from Power BI Desktop, the semantic model is included in the report. The semantic model is a collection of tables, relationships, and measures that define how data is structured and how it can be used in reports.
If you have access to a Power BI semantic model, you can create new reports based on that model. It's a great way to reuse existing content and save time. Semantic models can be promoted or even certified in order to help users find the right data for their reports. The Browse experience in the Power BI service is a great place to find semantic models that are available to you, regardless of where they're located.

Dashboards
Dashboards and reports in Power BI might look similar, but they have key differences. Dashboards are single-page visual summaries that can pull data from multiple reports and models, while reports can have multiple pages and use only one semantic model. Reports offer more interactive features like filtering, drilling down, and viewing data tables, while dashboards focus on quick insights. Both allow subscriptions, favorites, and natural language queries, but only dashboards support alerts on certain tiles.

Apps
Apps are an easy way for designers to share related content, like dashboards, semantic models, and reports, all in one place. It's easier to find content in the Power BI service when it's organized together as an app. After you install an app, you don't have to remember the names of several dashboards or reports because they're all together in one app.
For the app designer, it gives them control over the content included in the app and who can access it. They do not need to share each item individually or depend on the workspace access list. Apps are a great way to share content with a larger audience, such as an entire department or organization. You can even target multiple audiences in the same app.
Additionally, it gives app designers control over when updated content will be released as a new app version.
