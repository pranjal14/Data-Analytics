You've likely had the chance to load and transform data from numerous sources, build visuals, create measures, and even publish a report or two to Microsoft Power BI. The next step on your data analysis journey is to share these reports with a wider audience in your organization. This is where the Power BI service comes into play.
What is the Power BI service?
In a typical Power BI workflow, you begin by building a report in Power BI Desktop, then publishing it to the Power BI service. It's the Software as a Service (SaaS) part of Power BI and can be accessed through a web browser (https://app.powerbi.com). The Power BI service lets you consume and interact with reports, as well as individual visual elements found in those reports, right from your browser.
The Power BI service is composed of many building blocks, including workspaces, reports, semantic models, dashboards, and apps. Each of these components play a unique role in the Power BI ecosystem.

Workspaces
Workspaces are spaces for your Power BI content. They allow you to organize and manage your reports, semantic models, and dashboards. Workspaces can be created for different teams or projects within your organization, enabling collaboration and sharing of Power BI content.
Depending on the license mode, workspaces offer different levels of sharing, performance, and advanced features such as AI capabilities and higher refresh rates.

Reports
Once a report designer publishes a report to a Power BI workspace, the report becomes available to other users in that workspace. Users can then view it in their browser and interact with the visuals, and create their own reports based on the same semantic model.
A report has one or more pages, each containing one or more visuals. Presenting data as visuals makes it easier to grasp the meaning of what you're seeing. And, the visuals aren't static. You interact with the visuals and filters as you dig into the data to discover insights and find answers.
