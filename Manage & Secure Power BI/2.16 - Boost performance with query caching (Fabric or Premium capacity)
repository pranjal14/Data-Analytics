With the Query Caching feature, you can use the local caching services of Power BI to process query results. Instead of relying on the semantic model to calculate queries, you use cloud resources on your Fabric or Premium capacities in the Power BI service to load your report. Query caching ensures constant performance instead of overloading the semantic model resources.
Building on the scenario, you notice that some of your semantic models are causing the reports to load more slowly than before, an issue that is starting to annoy your users. The Sales team wants to know how they can improve performance and make these reports load faster. You decide to use Query Caching to solve this problem.
