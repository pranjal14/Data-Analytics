As a data modeler, you set up RLS by creating one or more roles. A role has a unique name in the model, and it usually includes one or more rules. Rules enforce filters on model tables by using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) filter expressions.

The static method in row-level security (RLS) uses a fixed value in the DAX filter, while the dynamic method uses a DAX function.

 Note

By default, a data model has no roles. A data model without roles means that users (who have permission to query the data model) have access to all model data.

It's possible to define a role that includes no rules. In this case, the role provides access to all rows of all model tables. This role set up would be suitable for an admin user who is allowed to view all data.

RLS involves several configuration steps. Begin by creating a report in Microsoft Power BI Desktop, which includes importing data, applying star schema design principles, and creating report visuals. Then, set up RLS roles using DAX and test them within Power BI Desktop. Once the roles are configured, deploy the report to Microsoft Power BI service, add members to the roles, and conduct final testing in the Power BI service.

Create a report in Power BI Desktop
Follow the typical steps to create a report in Power BI Desktop. Use Microsoft Power Query to retrieve and clean the data. Then, confirm that the relationships exists between the tables by using the Modeling tab. We recommend you apply star schema design principles to produce a model comprising dimension and fact tables. It’s common to set up Power BI to enforce rules that filter dimension tables, allowing model relationships to efficiently propagate those filters to fact tables.

Your next step is to create a Power BI report.
Notice how the preceding table has rows for all sales, including all departments. You will be limiting visibility so that only employees of a specific department can see their own sales.

Create RLS roles in Power BI Desktop
Power BI row-level security (RLS) uses DAX to control who can see which data. Consider it as always adding another filter to the appropriate users, regardless of the filters, slicers, or interactions that the users choose on a Power BI report.

To create RLS roles in Power BI Desktop, select the Modeling tab, and then select Manage Roles. On the Manage security roles page, create a role for each department, and then add a filter or DAX expression to it. For instance, you can create a role called Game and then add the filter or DAX expression [Department] = "Game". Then, whenever a member of that role interacts with the report, Power BI will add that filter to their interactions, thus limiting what they see.

A fixed value is used in the filter on the right side of the equal sign (in this case, "Game"). The intention is that, if you ever need to add a category, you will need to create a new role with a new value in the DAX expression.
