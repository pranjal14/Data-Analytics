Ensuring the quality and security of your organization's data is critical. Power BI provides tools to help you manage and protect your content effectively. Let's explore two essential practices for maintaining trustworthy and secure Power BI content. The first one is about endorsing your content, which helps users identify high-quality data. The second practice involves applying sensitivity labels to protect sensitive information.

Endorse your content
Endorsing your Power BI content is a crucial step in ensuring that users can easily identify and trust high-quality, authoritative data. Power BI provides two types of endorsements: promotion and certification. These endorsements help users navigate through large volumes of content and locate reliable resources for their needs.
Promotion allows content owners or members with write permissions in a workspace to highlight content they believe is valuable and ready for broader use. This collaborative approach encourages the sharing of useful data across the organization. Promoted content is marked with a badge, making it easily recognizable in lists and searches.
Certification, on the other hand, signifies that the content meets the organization's quality standards and is deemed authoritative. Only authorized reviewers, as defined by the Power BI administrator, can certify content. Certification ensures that users can rely on the content for critical decision-making. Certified content is also labeled with a distinct badge and is prioritized in searches.
By endorsing content, whether through promotion or certification, organizations can foster trust and improve the discoverability of valuable Power BI resources. Badges are visible in Power BI Desktop when creating a new report and searching for existing semantic models. This visibility ensures that report creators can easily identify and select high-quality, endorsed datasets, streamlining the report-building process and promoting the use of trusted data sources.
