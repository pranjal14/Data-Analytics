Business intelligence involves collaboration, and sharing semantic models across workspaces is a powerful way to collaborate within your organization. However, if your organization has many different semantic models that can be accessed by many users, you might want to take measures to manage those semantic models. For instance, you might want to direct your users to the most up-to-date and highest-quality semantic models in your workspaces, or you might want to restrict the reuse of semantic models across your workspaces.
