Introduction to dashboards
Microsoft Power BI dashboards are different than Power BI reports. Dashboards are made up of visuals from different reports and allow report consumers to create a single page of targeted data insights, with the option to explore more in a report.
Well-built dashboards capture the most important highlights of the story that you're trying to tell.
