When building dashboards, you can create a cohesive picture by applying the same theme as in your reports. Or apply a specific theme to reports and dashboards so that all report elements or tiles are uniform.

This consideration is important when you're building multiple dashboards. Power BI provides options to apply a theme directly to a dashboard as well as all visuals of a report.
