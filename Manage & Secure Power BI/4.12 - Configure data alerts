Configuring data alerts is a simple process to complete for a dashboard in Power BI. Data alerts can notify you or a user that a specific data point is above, below, or at a specific threshold that you can set.

Configure alerts
These alerts are features that are only available on Power BI service and they're available on such report elements such as KPI visuals, gauges, and cards.
After you have uploaded your reports to Power BI service and have pinned your chosen visuals to a dashboard, select the ellipsis (...) in the corner of the tile you want to set an alert for and then select Manage Alerts.
