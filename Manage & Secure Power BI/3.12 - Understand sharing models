Data analysts often need to share Power BI content with different audiences while maintaining control over access and permissions.
In this unit, you'll explore how sharing in Power BI Service can help you manage access to reports, dashboards, and semantic models effectively. For example, a retail company might use workspace roles to collaborate internally, share specific reports with external partners through item-level sharing, and distribute curated content to a broader audience in the company using Power BI Apps.

Workspace roles
Power BI Service provides four distinct workspace roles: Viewer, Contributor, Member, and Admin. These roles determine the level of access and permissions a user has within a workspace. It's important to note that workspace roles operate on an all-or-nothing basis, meaning that users with access to a workspace can view or interact with all the reports, dashboards, and semantic models within it. You cannot selectively exclude specific items from being shared when using this approach.

Viewer
The Viewer role is the most restrictive role in a workspace. Users with this role can only view and interact with the content, such as reports and dashboards, but cannot make any changes. This role is ideal for stakeholders who need to consume data without modifying it.
This is also the only role where Row-Level Security (RLS) will be enforced. RLS ensures that users can only view the data they are authorized to see, based on the security rules defined in the dataset. This makes the Viewer role particularly useful for scenarios where sensitive or restricted data needs to be shared securely.
