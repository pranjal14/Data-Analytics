Understanding the flow of data from the data source to its destination can be a challenge. Questions like "What happens if I move this data?" or "Why isn't this report up to date?" can be hard to answer. They might require a team of experts or deep investigation to understand. Power BI's data lineage view helps you answer these questions
Explore lineage view
In lineage view, you see the lineage relationships between all the artifacts in a workspace
Every workspace automatically has a lineage view. You need at least a Contributor role in the workspace to view it. In this view, you see all the workspace artifacts and how the data flows from one artifact to another.
You see the data sources from which the semantic models get their data. If a data source is connected via an on-premises gateway, the gateway information is added to the data source card.

On semantic models, you see the last refresh time, and if the semantic model is certified or promoted.

Perform semantic model impact analysis
When you make changes to a semantic model, or are considering making changes, it's important to be able to assess the potential impact of those changes on downstream reports and dashboards that depend on that semantic model
Performing this impact analysis is useful for semantic models that are shared across workspaces, where it's complicated to get a clear picture of downstream dependencies.
To perform semantic model impact analysis, select the impact analysis button on the semantic model card. The following screenshot demonstrates there's an additional report that depends on the semantic model. The report is in a different workspace, and the semantic model is shared with that workspace.

Perform data source impact analysis
Data source impact analysis helps you see where your data source is being used throughout your organization. This can be useful when the data source is temporarily or permanently taken offline, and you want to get an idea about who is impacted.
Similar to semantic model impact analysis, you can select the impact analysis button on the data source card.

Summary
This module allowed you to take advantage of the following features of Power BI to help you manage your semantic models:
Two data refresh options to help you automate the refresh process and make it more efficient.
Endorsement features for your most critical semantic models to help your users identify the semantic models that they should use.
The on-premises gateway and ideas on how to troubleshoot potential connectivity issues.
These semantic model management techniques will help you to increase the ease of access and up-to-date nature of your semantic models, and will help you build high-quality reports and dashboards so that your users can make real-time decisions.
