Understanding the flow of data from the data source to its destination can be a challenge. Questions like "What happens if I move this data?" or "Why isn't this report up to date?" can be hard to answer. They might require a team of experts or deep investigation to understand. Power BI's data lineage view helps you answer these questions
Explore lineage view
In lineage view, you see the lineage relationships between all the artifacts in a workspace
Every workspace automatically has a lineage view. You need at least a Contributor role in the workspace to view it. In this view, you see all the workspace artifacts and how the data flows from one artifact to another.
You see the data sources from which the semantic models get their data. If a data source is connected via an on-premises gateway, the gateway information is added to the data source card.

On semantic models, you see the last refresh time, and if the semantic model is certified or promoted.
