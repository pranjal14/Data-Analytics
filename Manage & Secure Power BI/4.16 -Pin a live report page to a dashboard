Power BI allows you to pin live report pages to dashboards, ensuring that your visuals reflect real-time changes. The iterative process of building reports and dashboards as business requirements evolve becomes easier with this feature.
Pin a live page
The Pin a live page feature reflects real-time changes, ensuring that your reports always stay up-to-date.

You can also pin entire report pages to a dashboard. These visuals are live, meaning that any changes you make on the report are immediately reflected on the selected dashboard.

Pinning a report page is a simple way to pin all visuals at once. All slicers and filters still work and that the visuals have the same data as in the report. The visuals appear as a page, so there are no reformatting options.

Any changes that you make to the underlying report automatically show on the dashboard when the page is refreshed.

To pin an entire page, select the ellipsis (...) on the navigation bar of the report and then select Pin to a dashboard > (Select dashboard) > Pin live.


Tip

Dashboards are intended to be a collection from various sources, not just as a "launching pad" for reports. We recommend that you pin at the tile level first and foremost, and if needed, the entire report page can also be pinned. Seeing an entire report page in a dashboard tile can be difficult.
