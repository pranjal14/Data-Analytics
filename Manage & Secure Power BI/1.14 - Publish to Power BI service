Imagine you have created a report in the Power BI Desktop and now you want to share it to your colleagues. Sending the .pbix file via email isn't the best option, as the file might be too large, and it can be difficult to keep track of the latest version. Also, your colleagues might not have the same version of Power BI Desktop installed, which could lead to compatibility issues.
Instead, you can publish the report to the Power BI service, where your colleagues can access it online. This process is called publishing.

Publish from Power BI Desktop
In Power BI Desktop, choose File > Publish > Publish to Power BI or select Publish on the Home ribbon.
If you aren't signed in yet with your Microsoft Entra ID (work or school account), you're prompted to do so. After signing in, you'll see a dialog box that allows you to select the workspace where you want to publish the report.
