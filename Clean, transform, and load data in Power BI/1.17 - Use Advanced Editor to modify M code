Each time you shape data in Power Query, you create a step in the Power Query process. Those steps can be reordered, deleted, and modified where it makes sense. Each cleaning step that you made was likely created by using the graphical interface, but Power Query uses the M language behind the scenes. The combined steps are available to read by using the Power Query Advanced Editor. The M language is always available to be read and modified directly.â€¯ It is not required that you use M code to take advantage of Power Query. You will rarely need to write M code, but it can still prove useful. Because each step in Power Query is written in M code, even if the UI created it for you, you can use those steps to learn M code and customize it to suit your needs.
After creating steps to clean data, select the View ribbon of Power Query and then select Advanced Editor.
