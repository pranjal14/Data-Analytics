Power Query Editor in Power BI Desktop allows you to shape (transform) your imported data. You can accomplish actions such as renaming columns or tables, changing text to numbers, removing rows, setting the first row as headers, and much more. It is important to shape your data to ensure that it meets your needs and is suitable for use in reports.
You have loaded raw sales data from two sources into a Power BI model. Some of the data came from a .csv file that was created manually in Microsoft Excel by the Sales team. The other data was loaded through a connection to your organization's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Now, when you look at the data in Power BI Desktop, you notice that it's in disarray; some data that you don't need and some data that you do need are in the wrong format.
You need to use Power Query Editor to clean up and shape this data before you can start building reports.

Get started with Power Query Editor
To start shaping your data, open Power Query Editor by selecting the Transform data option on the Home tab of Power BI Desktop.
In Power Query Editor, the data in your selected query displays in the middle of the screen and, on the left side, the Queries pane lists the available queries (tables).
When you work in Power Query Editor, all steps that you take to shape your data are recorded. Then, each time the query connects to the data source, it automatically applies your steps, so your data is always shaped the way that you specified. Power Query Editor only makes changes to a particular view of your data, so you can feel confident about changes that are being made to your original data source. You can see a list of your steps on the right side of the screen, in the Query Settings pane, along with the query's properties.
The Power Query Editor ribbon contains many buttons you can use to select, view, and shape your data.

Identify column headers and names
The first step in shaping your initial data is to identify the column headers and names within the data and then evaluate where they are located to ensure that they are in the right place.
In the following screenshot, the source data in the csv file for SalesTarget (sample not provided) had a target categorized by products and a subcategory split by months, both of which are organized into columns.
However, you notice that the data did not import as expected.
Consequently, the data is difficult to read. A problem has occurred with the data in its current state because column headers are in different rows (marked in red), and several columns have undescriptive names, such as Column1, Column2, and so on.
When you have identified where the column headers and names are located, you can make changes to reorganize the data.

Promote headers
When a table is created in Power BI Desktop, Power Query Editor assumes that all data belongs in table rows. However, a data source might have a first row that contains column names, which is what happened in the previous SalesTarget example. To correct this inaccuracy, you need to promote the first table row into column headers.
You can promote headers in two ways: by selecting the Use First Row as Headers option on the Home tab or by selecting the drop-down button next to Column1 and then selecting Use First Row as Headers.
