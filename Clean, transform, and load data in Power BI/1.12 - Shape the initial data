Power Query Editor in Power BI Desktop allows you to shape (transform) your imported data. You can accomplish actions such as renaming columns or tables, changing text to numbers, removing rows, setting the first row as headers, and much more. It is important to shape your data to ensure that it meets your needs and is suitable for use in reports.
You have loaded raw sales data from two sources into a Power BI model. Some of the data came from a .csv file that was created manually in Microsoft Excel by the Sales team. The other data was loaded through a connection to your organization's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Now, when you look at the data in Power BI Desktop, you notice that it's in disarray; some data that you don't need and some data that you do need are in the wrong format.
You need to use Power Query Editor to clean up and shape this data before you can start building reports.
