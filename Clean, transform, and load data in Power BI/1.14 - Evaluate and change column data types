When you import a table from any data source, Power BI Desktop automatically starts scanning the first 1,000 rows (default setting) and tries to detect the type of data in the columns. Some situations might occur where Power BI Desktop doesn't detect the correct data type. Where incorrect data types occur, you'll experience performance issues.
You have a higher chance of getting data type errors when you're dealing with flat files, such as comma-separated values (.CSV) files and Excel workbooks (.XLSX), because data was entered manually into the worksheets and mistakes were made. Conversely, in databases, the data types are predefined when tables or views are created.
A best practice is to evaluate the column data types in Power Query Editor before you load the data into a Power BI semantic model. If you determine that a data type is incorrect, you can change it. You might also want to apply a format to the values in a column and change the summarization default for a column.
To continue with the scenario where you're cleaning and transforming sales data in preparation for reporting, you now need to evaluate the columns to ensure that they have the correct data type. You need to correct any errors that you identify.
You evaluate the OrderDate column. As expected, it contains numeric data, but Power BI Desktop has incorrectly set the column data type to Text. To report on this column, you need to change the data type from Text to Date.
