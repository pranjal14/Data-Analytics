When you import data from multiple sources into Power BI Desktop, the data retains its predefined table and column names. You might want to change some of these names so that they are in a consistent format, easier to work with, and more meaningful to a user. You can use Power Query Editor in Power BI Desktop to make these name changes and simplify your data structure.
To continue with the previous scenario where you shaped the initial data in your model, you need to take further action to simplify the structure of the sales data and get it ready for developing reports for the Sales team. You have already renamed the columns, but now you need to examine the names of the queries (tables) to determine if any improvements can be made. You also need to review the contents of the columns and replace any values that require correction.

Rename a query
It's good practice to change uncommon or unhelpful query names to names that are more obvious or that the user is more familiar with. For instance, if you import a product fact table into Power BI Desktop and the query name displays as FactProductTable, you might want to change it to a more user-friendly name, such as Products. Similarly, if you import a view, the view might have a name that contains a prefix of v, such as vProduct. People might find this name unclear and confusing, so you might want to remove the prefix.
In this example, you have examined the name of the TargetSales query and realize that this name is unhelpful because you'll have a query with this name for every year. To avoid confusion, you want to add the year to the query name.
In Power Query Editor, in the Queries pane to the left of your data, select the query that you want to rename. Right-click the query and select Rename. Edit the current name or type a new name, and then press Enter.
