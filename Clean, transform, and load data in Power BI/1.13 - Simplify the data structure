When you import data from multiple sources into Power BI Desktop, the data retains its predefined table and column names. You might want to change some of these names so that they are in a consistent format, easier to work with, and more meaningful to a user. You can use Power Query Editor in Power BI Desktop to make these name changes and simplify your data structure.
To continue with the previous scenario where you shaped the initial data in your model, you need to take further action to simplify the structure of the sales data and get it ready for developing reports for the Sales team. You have already renamed the columns, but now you need to examine the names of the queries (tables) to determine if any improvements can be made. You also need to review the contents of the columns and replace any values that require correction.
